LID - 10.1080/09273948.2022.2103829 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the UVHER project is to evaluate the risk of development of
      optic nerve damage in patients with herpetic anterior uveitis (AU) prospectively 
      followed over 2 years. Herein, we described the baseline characteristics.
      METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective study. An aqueous humour tap was
      performed. Only patients with a positive PCR were included. Clinical
      characteristics, optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and visual field
      (VF) abnormalities were registered. RESULTS: 27 patients were included: 18 Herpes
      Simplex (HSV), one Varicella Zoster (VVZ), and 8Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Patients
      with HSV-AU had severe inflammation, iris atrophy and corneal involvement. In
      patients with CMV-AU, less inflammation and medium-to-large keratic precipitates 
      were observed. OCT showed a thinner RNFL and GCL in CMV-AU patients in comparison
      to HSV patients. VF showed abnormalities in six cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in
      the UVHER cohort showed the typical clinical manifestations of herpetic AU. In
      CMV patients, optic nerve damage was observed at baseline, and in HSV patients,
      inflammation was more severe.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe herpetic ocular infections following SARS-CoV-2
      vaccinations. METHODS: A retrospective study of herpetic ocular infections after 
      BNT162b2mRNA vaccination and a literature review. RESULTS: A cohort of five
      patients: three varicella zoster virus (VZV) and two herpes simplex virus (HSV)
      cases, as well as 19 literature cases: 9 cases of VZV and 10 cases of HSV post
      BNT162b2mRNA, AZD1222, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccinations. All cases presented
      within 28 days post vaccination. Most VZV and HSV cases (15/19) reported in the
      literature presented post first vaccine dose, while in our cohort 2 VZV cases
      presented post second dose and both HSV cases and one VZV case post third dose.
      The most common presentations were HZO with ocular involvement and HSV keratitis.
      All eyes had complete resolution; however, one had retinal detachment and three
      corneal scars. CONCLUSION: Herpetic ocular infections may develop shortly after
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Overall, the outcome is good.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) Reactivation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: 
      A Brief Narrative Review.
LID - 10.1007/s40121-022-00674-0 [doi]
AB  - Systemic or pulmonary reactivations of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) have been
      reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19, posing a dilemma for
      clinicians in terms of their diagnostic and clinical relevance. Prevalence of
      HSV-1 reactivation may be as high as > 40% in this population, but with large
      heterogeneity across studies, likely reflecting the different samples and/or
      cut-offs for defining reactivation. There is frequently agreement on the clinical
      significance of HSV-1 reactivation in the presence of severe manifestations
      clearly attributable to the virus. However, the clinical implications of HSV-1
      reactivations in the absence of manifest signs and symptoms remain controversial.
      Our review aims at providing immunological background and at reviewing clinical
      findings on HSV-1 reactivations in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Conformational Changes in Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoprotein C.
PG  - e0016322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00163-22 [doi]
AB  - Low endosomal pH facilitates herpesvirus entry in a cell-specific manner. Herpes 
      simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes significant morbidity and death in humans
      worldwide. HSV-1 enters cells by low-pH and neutral-pH pathways. Low-pH-induced
      conformational changes in the HSV envelope glycoprotein B (gB) may mediate
      membrane fusion during viral entry. HSV-1 gC, a 511-amino acid, type I integral
      membrane glycoprotein, mediates HSV-1 attachment to host cell surface
      glycosaminoglycans, but this interaction is not essential for viral entry. We
      previously demonstrated that gC regulates low-pH viral entry independent of its
      known role in cell attachment. Low-pH-triggered conformational changes in gB
      occur at a lower pH when gC is absent, suggesting that gC positively regulates gB
      conformational changes. Here, we demonstrate that mildly acidic pH triggers
      conformational changes in gC itself. Low-pH treatment of virions induced
      antigenic changes in distinct gC epitopes, and those changes were reversible. One
      of these gC epitopes is recognized by a monoclonal antibody that binds to a
      linear sequence that includes residues within gC amino acids 33 to 123. This
      antibody inhibited low-pH entry of HSV, suggesting that its gC N-terminal epitope
      is particularly important. We propose that gC plays a critical role in HSV entry 
      through a low-pH endocytosis pathway, which is a major entry route in human
      epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause
      lifelong latent infections and are characterized by multiple entry pathways. The 
      HSV envelope gC regulates HSV entry by a low-pH entry route. The fusion protein
      gB undergoes pH-triggered conformational changes that are facilitated by gC.
      Here, we report that gC itself undergoes a conformational change at low pH. A
      monoclonal antibody to gC that binds to a region that undergoes pH-induced
      changes also selectively inhibits HSV low-pH entry, corroborating the importance 
      of gC in the low-pH entry pathway. This study illustrates the complex role of
      endosomal pH during HSV entry and provides novel insights into the functions of
      gC.

      Infection.
PG  - e26371
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26371 [doi]
AB  - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare disease characterized by
      autoantibodies directed at red blood cells. Patients typically present with
      anemia and are diagnosed by positive direct antiglobulin (DAT) test. AIHA is
      subclassified into warm or cold based on antibodies involved and depending on
      their optimal temperature in which they react with RBC antigens. Warm AIHA can be
      either primary (idiopathic) or secondary depending on etiology. Secondary causes 
      are associated with malignancy, connective tissue and inflammatory diseases,
      infections (typically viral infections), or drugs (e.g., antibiotics,
      chemotherapeutic agents). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that is
      commonly associated with cold AIHA, with only one reported case of EBV-induced
      warm AIHA. It has been postulated that antibodies against EBV cross-react with
      antigens expressed on RBC membranes and activate the complement cascade
      similarly. This case report describes a case of a 32-year-old male who presented 
      with warm AIHA secondary to EBV reinfection.

      non-responsiveness). Beyond tofacitinib, a pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor
      already approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC, novel more selective
      molecules like filgotinib are being currently evaluated in randomized clinical
      trials. We aimed to review the current evidence on filgotinib, a JAK-1
      preferential inhibitor, in the treatment of UC and its place in therapy in the
      current scenario. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify relevant
      studies: those investigating the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in the
      treatment of UC patients were included in this narrative review. Results: The
      current preliminary data have shown that filgotinib is safe and effective in
      inducing clinical end endoscopic response in both biologic-naive and
      biologic-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe UC, also with high
      inflammatory burden at baseline. In the SELECTION trial, one case of pulmonary
      embolism occurred with filgotinib 200 mg induction, and three venous thrombosis
      cases were observed in the placebo maintenance/LTE; the incidence of herpes
      zoster was </=1% in all UC treated patients. Filgotinib represents an appealing
      treatment option for its high selectiveness, route of administration and rapidity
      of action; cost-effectiveness studies and head-to-head trials are needed to
      better define its place in therapy.

TI  - TRIM18 is a critical regulator of viral myocarditis and organ inflammation.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s12929-022-00840-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections by viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 could cause organ inflammations such as myocarditis, pneumonia and 
      encephalitis. Innate immunity to viral nucleic acids mediates antiviral immunity 
      as well as inflammatory organ injury. However, the innate immune mechanisms that 
      control viral induced organ inflammations are unclear. METHODS: To understand the
      role of the E3 ligase TRIM18 in controlling viral myocarditis and organ
      inflammation, wild-type and Trim18 knockout mice were infected with
      coxsackievirus B3 for inducing viral myocarditis, influenza A virus PR8 strain
      and human adenovirus for inducing viral pneumonia, and herpes simplex virus type 
      I for inducing herpes simplex encephalitis. Mice survivals were monitored, and
      heart, lung and brain were harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry
      analysis. Real-time PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay, luciferase assay, flow cytometry, over-expression and
      knockdown techniques were used to understand the molecular mechanisms of TRIM18
      in regulating type I interferon (IFN) production after virus infection in this
      study. RESULTS: We find that knockdown or deletion of TRIM18 in human or mouse
      macrophages enhances production of type I IFN in response to double strand (ds)
      RNA and dsDNA or RNA and DNA virus infection. Importantly, deletion of TRIM18
      protects mice from viral myocarditis, viral pneumonia, and herpes simplex
      encephalitis due to enhanced type I IFN production in vivo. Mechanistically, we
      show that TRIM18 recruits protein phosphatase 1A (PPM1A) to dephosphorylate TANK 
      binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which inactivates TBK1 to block TBK1 from interacting
      with its upstream adaptors, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) and
      stimulator of interferon genes (STING), thereby dampening antiviral signaling
      during viral infections. Moreover, TRIM18 stabilizes PPM1A by inducing K63-linked
      ubiquitination of PPM1A. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that TRIM18 serves as 
      a negative regulator of viral myocarditis, lung inflammation and brain damage by 
      downregulating innate immune activation induced by both RNA and DNA viruses. Our 
      data reveal that TRIM18 is a critical regulator of innate immunity in viral
      induced diseases, thereby identifying a potential therapeutic target for
      treatment.

TI  - Upadacitinib for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
      (SELECT-AXIS 2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Upadacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be
      effective in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. We aimed to assess the
      efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. 
      METHODS: The SELECT-AXIS 2 non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis study was a
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 113
      sites across 23 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
      Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Mexico,
      Poland, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, and the
      USA). Eligible adults had active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, with
      objective signs of inflammation based on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein and
      an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients were
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or placebo 
      using interactive response technology. Random treatment assignment was stratified
      by MRI inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and screening high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein status (MRI-positive and C-reactive protein-positive,
      MRI-positive and C-reactive protein-negative, and MRI-negative and C-reactive
      protein-positive) and previous exposure to biologic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (yes vs no). Treatment assignment was masked from patients,
      investigators, study site personnel, and the study sponsor. The primary endpoint 
      was the proportion of patients with an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
      international Society 40 (ASAS40) response at week 14. Analyses were performed on
      the full analysis set of patients, who underwent random allocation and received
      at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04169373. FINDINGS: Between Nov 26, 2019, and May 20,
      2021, 314 patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis were
      enrolled into the study, and 313 received study drug (156 in the upadacitinib
      group and 157 in the placebo group); 295 (94%) patients (145 in the upadacitinib 
      group and 150 in the placebo group) received treatment for the full 14 weeks. A
      significantly higher ASAS40 response rate was achieved with upadacitinib compared
      with placebo at week 14 (70 [45%] of 156 patients vs 35 [23%] of 157 patients;
      p<0.0001; treatment difference 22%, 95% CI 12-32). The rate of adverse events up 
      to week 14 was similar in the upadacitinib group (75 [48%] of 156 patients) and
      placebo group (72 [46%] of 157 patients). Serious adverse events and adverse
      events leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in four (3%) of 156
      patients in the upadacitinib group and two (1%) of 157 patients in the placebo
      group. Few patients had serious infections or herpes zoster in either treatment
      group (each event occurred in two [1%] of 156 patients in the upadacitinib group 
      and one [1%] of 157 patients in the placebo group). Five (3%) of 156 patients in 
      the upadacitinib group had neutropenia; no events of neutropenia occurred in the 
      placebo group. No opportunistic infections, malignancies, major adverse
      cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events, or deaths were reported with
      upadacitinib treatment. INTERPRETATION: Upadacitinib significantly improved the
      signs and symptoms of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis compared with
      placebo at week 14. These findings support the potential of upadacitinib as a new
      therapeutic option in patients with active non-radiographic axial
      spondyloarthritis. FUNDING: AbbVie.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabies kills around 60 000 people each year. ChAdOx2 RabG, a simian
      adenovirus-vectored rabies vaccine candidate, might have potential to provide
      low-cost single-dose pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis. This first-in-human study
      aimed to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults. METHODS: We
      did a single-centre phase 1 study of ChAdOx2 RabG, administered as a single
      intramuscular dose, with non-randomised open-label dose escalation at the Centre 
      for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Oxford, UK. Healthy adults were
      sequentially allocated to groups receiving low (5 x 10(9) viral particles),
      middle (2.5 x 10(10) viral particles), and high doses (5 x 10(10) viral
      particles) of ChAdOx2 RabG and were followed up to day 56 after vaccination. The 
      primary objective was to assess safety. The secondary objective was to assess
      immunogenicity with the internationally standardised rabies virus neutralising
      antibody assay. In an optional follow-up phase 1 year after enrolment, we
      measured antibody maintenance then administered a licensed rabies vaccine (to
      simulate post-exposure prophylaxis) and measured recall responses. The trial is
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04162600, and is now closed to new
      participants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 2 and Oct 28, 2020, 12 adults received low
      (n=3), middle (n=3), and high doses (n=6) of ChAdOx2 RabG. Participants reported 
      predominantly mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. There were no serious adverse
      events. Virus neutralising antibody concentrations exceeded the recognised
      correlate of protection (0.5 IU/mL) in three middle-dose recipients and six
      high-dose recipients within 56 days of vaccination (median 18.0 IU/mL). The
      median peak virus neutralising antibody concentrations within 56 days were 0.7
      IU/mL (range 0.0-54.0 IU/mL) for the low-dose group, 18.0 IU/mL (0.7-18.0 IU/mL) 
      for the middle-dose group, and 18.0 IU/mL (6.0-486.0 IU/mL) for the high-dose
      group. Nine participants returned for the additional follow-up after 1 year. Of
      these nine participants, virus neutralising antibody titres of more than 0.5
      IU/mL were maintained in six of seven who had received middle-dose or high-dose
      ChAdOx2 RabG. Within 7 days of administration of the first dose of a licensed
      rabies vaccine, nine participants had virus neutralising antibody titres of more 
      than 0.5 IU/mL. INTERPRETATION: In this study, ChAdOx2 RabG showed an acceptable 
      safety and tolerability profile and encouraging immunogenicity, supporting
      further clinical evaluation. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council and Engineering

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV (human papillomavirus) is an important cause of cervical cancer. 
      Cervical-vaginal infection with pathogens, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV),
      bacterial vaginosis Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal candidiasis could be a
      cofactor. This study aimed to assess the relationship between vaginal infection
      with HPV genotype and cytology test results and analyze the relationship between 
      vaginal and HPV infections and cervical cancer. METHODS: We performed a
      district-based study to elucidate the relationship among the vaginal and HPV
      infections and cervical cancer. We collected the cervical exfoliation data of
      23,724 women admitted to the Shanghai Zhoupu Hospital and received ThinPrep
      cytology test (TCT) and HPV detection between 2014 and 2019. RESULTS: Total
      vaginal infection rate was 5.3%, and the HPV-positive group had a slightly higher
      vaginal infection rate than the HPV-negative group (P < 0.01). The incidence rate
      of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer with vaginal infection
      was higher than without vaginal infection (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HPV/vaginal
      infection-positive women tended to have abnormal results of TCT. Women with
      vaginal infection were more likely to develop HPV infection. HSV combined with
      HPV infection was noted as a causal factor for HSIL.

TI  - 72 weeks post-partum follow-up of dolutegravir versus efavirenz initiated in late
      pregnancy (DolPHIN-2): an open-label, randomised controlled study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Late initiation of antiretrovirals in pregnancy is associated with
      increased risk of perinatal transmission and higher infant mortality. We report
      the final 72-week postpartum results for efficacy and safety of
      dolutegravir-based compared with efavirenz-based regimens in mothers and infants.
      METHODS: DolPHIN-2 was a randomised, open-label trial. Pregnant women in South
      Africa and Uganda aged at least 18 years, with untreated but confirmed HIV
      infection and an estimated gestation of at least 28 weeks, initiating
      antiretroviral therapy in third trimester were eligible for inclusion. Eligible
      women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either dolutegravir-based (50 mg
      dolutegravir, 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and either 200 mg
      emtricitabine in South Africa or 300 mg lamivudine in Uganda) or efavirenz-based 
      (fixed dose combination 600 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus either
      emtricitabine in South Africa or lamivudine in Uganda) therapy. The primary
      efficacy outcome was the time to a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL
      measured at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks postpartum with a Cox model adjusting for
      viral load and CD4 cell count. Safety endpoints were summarised by the number of 
      women and infants with events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT03249181. FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and Aug 15, 2018, 280 women were screened
      for inclusion, of whom 268 (96%) women were randomly assigned: 133 (50%) to the
      efavirenz group and 135 (50%) to the dolutegravir group. 250 (93%; 125 [50%] in
      the efavirenz group and 125 [50%] in the dolutegravir group) women were included 
      in the intention-to-treat analysis of efficacy. Median time to viral load of less
      than 50 copies per mL was 4.1 weeks (IQR 4.0-5.1) in the dolutegravir group
      compared with 12.1 weeks (10.7-13.3) in the efavirenz group (adjusted hazard
      ratio [HR] 1.93 [95% CI 1.5-2.5]). At 72 weeks postpartum, 116 (93%) mothers in
      the dolutegravir group and 114 (91%) in the efavirenz group had a viral load of
      less than 50 copies per mL. Of 57 (21%) mothers with a severe adverse event,
      three (2%) in the dolutegravir group and five (4%) in the efavirenz group were
      related to the drug (dolutegravir drug-related events were one woman each with
      suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, herpes zoster meningitis; efavirenz
      drug-related events were one woman each with suicide attempt and liver cirrhosis,
      and three people with drug-induced liver injury). Of 136 (56%) infants in whom
      severe adverse events were recorded, none were related to the study drugs. In
      addition to the three infant HIV infections detected at birth in the dolutegravir
      group that have been previously reported, an additional transmission in the
      efavirenz group occurred during breastfeeding despite optimal maternal viral
      suppression and serial negative infant tests in the first year of life.
      INTERPRETATION: Dolutegravir was safe and well tolerated, supporting updated WHO 
      treatment recommendations in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Infant HIV
      transmissions can occur during breastfeeding despite persistently undetectable
      maternal viral load highlighting the need for continued infant testing. FUNDING:

TI  - Epithelial HVEM maintains intraepithelial T cell survival and contributes to host
      protection.
PG  - eabm6931
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abm6931 [doi]
AB  - Intraepithelial T cells (IETs) are in close contact with intestinal epithelial
      cells and the underlying basement membrane, and they detect invasive pathogens.
      How intestinal epithelial cells and basement membrane influence IET survival and 
      function, at steady state or after infection, is unclear. The herpes virus entry 
      mediator (HVEM), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is constitutively
      expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and is important for protection from
      pathogenic bacteria. Here, we showed that at steady-state LIGHT, an HVEM ligand, 
      binding to epithelial HVEM promoted the survival of small intestine IETs. RNA-seq
      and addition of HVEM ligands to epithelial organoids indicated that HVEM
      increased epithelial synthesis of basement membrane proteins, including collagen 
      IV, which bound to beta1 integrins expressed by IETs. Therefore, we proposed that
      IET survival depended on beta1 integrin binding to collagen IV and showed that
      beta1 integrin-collagen IV interactions supported IET survival in vitro.
      Moreover, the absence of beta1 integrin expression by T lymphocytes decreased TCR
      alphabeta(+) IETs in vivo. Intravital microscopy showed that the patrolling
      movement of IETs was reduced without epithelial HVEM. As likely consequences of
      decreased number and movement, protective responses to Salmonella enterica were
      reduced in mice lacking either epithelial HVEM, HVEM ligands, or beta1 integrins.
      Therefore, IETs, at steady state and after infection, depended on HVEM expressed 
      by epithelial cells for the synthesis of collagen IV by epithelial cells.
      Collagen IV engaged beta1 integrins on IETs that were important for their
      maintenance and for their protective function in mucosal immunity.

TI  - Virus Dynamics and Decay in Evaporating Human Saliva Droplets on Fomites.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02311 [doi]
AB  - The transmission of most respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, occurs via 
      virus-containing respiratory droplets, and thus, factors that affect virus
      viability in droplet residues on surfaces are of critical medical and public
      health importance. Relative humidity (RH) is known to play a role in virus
      survival, with a U-shaped relationship between RH and virus viability. The
      mechanisms affecting virus viability in droplet residues, however, are unclear.
      This study examines the structure and evaporation dynamics of virus-containing
      saliva droplets on fomites and their impact on virus viability using four model
      viruses: vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus 1, Newcastle disease
      virus, and coronavirus HCoV-OC43. The results support the hypothesis that the
      direct contact of antiviral proteins and virions within the "coffee ring" region 
      of the droplet residue gives rise to the observed U-shaped relationship between
      virus viability and RH. Viruses survive much better at low and high RH, and their
      viability is substantially reduced at intermediate RH. A phenomenological theory 
      explaining this phenomenon and a quantitative model analyzing and correlating the
      experimentally measured virus survivability are developed on the basis of the
      observations. The mechanisms by which RH affects virus viability are explored. At
      intermediate RH, antiviral proteins have optimal influence on virions because of 
      their largest contact time and overlap area, which leads to the lowest level of
      virus activity.

AB  - Secondary Immunodeficiency in Rheumatology Abstract. For the treatment of
      autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases an immunosuppressive therapy with
      conventional, small molecule or biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDS) plays a key role. This may lead to secondary immunodeficiency with an
      increased risk for infections, which we discuss in the present article. The risk 
      for reactivation of chronic hepatitis B increases particularly with
      glucocorticoid dosages of >/= 20mg/d for longer than four weeks, with
      B-cell-depleting therapies, followed by anti-TNF-alpha-inhibitors. The latter
      also represent a risk for the reactivation of latent tuberculosis. High doses of 
      glucocorticosteroids for prolonged periods increase the risk for pneumonia with
      Pneumocystis jirovecii, especially if combined with other DMARDs. An elevated
      risk for Herpes zoster exists for B-cell depletion, TNF-alpha-inhibition and for 
      JAK blockade. Severe immunosuppression (B-cell depletion, cyclophosphamide,
      mycophenolate mofetil, JAK inhibitors, prednisone >/= 20mg/d or combination
      therapy) increase the risk for severe COVID-19 infections.

AB  - Cutaneous and subcutaneous soft tissue metastases are rare in lung adenocarcinoma
      and suggest poor prognosis. We report a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who
      initially presented with cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases to the abdomen
      that were initially presumed to be herpes zoster and an occult subcutaneous soft 
      tissue mass. Because the lesions progressed over 3 weeks despite routine herpes
      zoster treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed a presumed 
      sarcoma; however, (18)F-fluourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography demonstrated pulmonary lesions. Biopsy of the abdominal lesion
      confirmed poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. Early diagnosis of soft
      tissue metastasis can be difficult. Clinicians should suspect internal organ
      malignancy when a progressive cutaneous or subcutaneous soft tissue lesion is
      encountered.

TI  - Incident and recurrent herpes zoster for first-line bDMARD and tsDMARD users in
      seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients: a nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/s13075-022-02871-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-dependent risks of overall, incident, and recurrent
      herpes zoster (HZ) during first-line biologic DMARD (bDMARD) or targeted
      synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) treatment among patients with seropositive rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in terms of HZ risk. METHODS: A total of 11,720 patients with
      seropositive RA who were prescribed bDMARD or tofacitinib between January 2011
      and January 2019 from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service
      database were studied. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
      was adopted to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence
      interval (CI) for the risk of HZ dependent on the choice of first-line bDMARDs or
      tsDMARD, including etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, tocilizumab,
      rituximab, tofacitinib, and abatacept. RESULTS: During the 34,702 person-years of
      follow-up, 1686 cases (14.4%) of HZ were identified, including 1372 (11.7%)
      incident and 314 (2.7%) recurrent HZs. Compared with that of the abatacept group,
      tofacitinib increased the overall risk (aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.61-3.76; P<0.001),
      incidence (aHR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.18-3.37; P=0.011), and recurrence (aHR, 3.69; 95%
      CI, 1.77-7.69; P<0.001) of HZ. Infliximab (aHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06-1.74; P=0.017)
      and adalimumab (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.64; P=0.032) also increased the overall
      HZ risk. Moreover, a history of HZ was found to be an independent risk factor for
      HZ (aHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.33-1.78; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HZ risk is significantly
      increased in RA patients with a history of HZ after the initiation of bDMARDs or 
      tsDMARD. The risk of incident and recurrent HZ was higher after tofacitinib
      treatment in patients with RA than that after treatment with bDMARDs.
      Individualized characteristics and history of HZ should be considered when
      selecting bDMARDs or tsDMARD for RA patients considering HZ risks.

TI  - Correlation Between Electromyography and Severity and Prognosis of Upper Limb
      Herpes Zoster.
PG  - E749-E757
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are differences in the clinical treatment schemes for patients 
      with different severities of herpes zoster (HZ). Therefore, effective and
      accurate evaluation of disease severity is of great significance for the
      formulation of treatment plans. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) with long-term
      chronic pain leads to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts, which
      place a heavy burden on society and the family. Therefore, identifying risk
      factors and taking early intervention to reduce the occurrence of PHN is
      meaningful. Electromyography (EMG) can provide technical support for the early
      diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. However, the application of EMG in HZ and PHN
      has rarely been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare the detection 
      indices of EMG in patients with different severities and prognoses of HZ and to
      analyze the application of EMG in severity and prognosis of HZ. OBJECTIVE: This
      study aimed to explore the relationship between EMG and severity and prognosis of
      upper limb HZ. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, observational study. SETTING: The
      study was carried out in the Pain Department of the affiliated Hospital of
      Jiaxing College in Jiaxing, China. METHODS: A total of 91 patients with upper
      limb HZ at the First Hospital of Jiaxing between January 2015 and August 2021
      were enrolled. The patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe HZ
      groups according to their numeric rating scale (NRS) scores. The occurrence of
      PHN was defined as a poor prognosis. The patients were divided into non-PHN and
      PHN groups according to the occurrence of PHN. Motor and sensory conduction
      indices of the median nerve were measured in each group. Spearman's correlation
      analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the EMG-related data of the
      median nerve and the NRS score and muscle strength. Univariate and multivariate
      logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent influencing
      factors of PHN in patients with upper limb HZ, and the receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of
      EMG-related data in patients with upper limb HZ. RESULTS: Among 91 patients,
      there were 29 patients in the mild HZ group, 31 in the moderate HZ group, and 31 
      in the severe HZ group. The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude of
      the median nerve in the severe and moderate HZ groups was lower than that in the 
      mild HZ group, and that in the severe HZ group was lower than that in the
      moderate HZ group (F = 22.192, P < 0.05). Through Spearman's correlation
      analysis, it was found that the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and SNAP 
      amplitudes of the median nerve on the affected limb were negatively correlated
      with the NRS score (r = -0.266, P = 0.011; r = -0.778, P < 0.001), and there was 
      no significant correlation between each index and muscle strength (P > 0.05).
      Among 91 patients, 44 and 47 were in the non-PHN and PHN groups, respectively.
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the CMAP
      amplitude of the median nerve on the affected limb (OR = 0.241, 95% CI:
      0.098-0.567, P = 0.001) and SNAP amplitude (OR = 0.268, 95% CI: 0.110-0.628, P = 
      0.002) were independent influencing factors of PHN. Through the analysis of the
      ROC curve, it was found that the CMAP and SNAP amplitudes of the median nerve on 
      the affected limb had a high predictive value for PHN (AUC = 0.657, P = 0.010;
      AUC = 0.773, P < 0.001). The cutoff values were 5.45 mV and 10.80 mV,
      respectively; and the predictive value of the 2 indices combined was the highest 
      (AUC = 0.785, P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The nonrandomized, single-center, small
      sample size, and retrospective design are major limitations of this study.
      CONCLUSION: The CMAP and SNAP amplitudes of the median nerve on the affected limb
      were related to the degree of pain in patients with upper limb HZ. The CMAP and
      SNAP amplitudes of the median nerve on the affected limb can be used as
      prognostic factors for patients with upper limb HZ, and CMAP amplitude combined
      with SNAP amplitude is more valuable in predicting prognosis.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness evidence of herpes zoster vaccines in the U.S. A systematic
      literature review was undertaken for U.S. studies focused on the
      cost-effectiveness of herpes zoster vaccines. Eligibility criteria included
      studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the recombinant zoster vaccine
      (RZV) and zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and were published between 2015 and 2021.
      Article titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify relevant publications. The
      Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) criteria for
      economic evaluations were used to evaluate the studies. Eleven published studies 
      met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven studies compared RZV and ZVL. Four
      studies compared ZVL dosing regimens with or without a no vaccine option. All
      studies incorporated health system costs. Ten out of eleven (90.9%) studies
      conducted their analyses from a societal perspective and included indirect costs.
      For measurements of effectiveness, ten of eleven (90.9%) studies estimated
      quality-adjusted life years, four (36.4%) used shingles cases averted, two
      (18.2%) employed deaths prevented, and one (9.1%) measured life years saved. All 
      studies that compared RZV with no vaccine found RZV to be a cost-effective
      strategy to prevent both shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. Additionally,
      these analyses showed that RZV consistently dominated ZVL. Compliance with the
      second RZV dose was important for full benefit of the vaccine. The studies
      identified in this systematic review identified well-constructed
      cost-effectiveness analyses of herpes zoster vaccines in the U.S. RZV was more
      cost-effective than no vaccine or ZVL. This systematic review supports removal of
      ZVL from the U.S. market.

TI  - The Role of Pyrazolopyridine Derivatives on Different Steps of Herpes Simplex
      Virus Type-1 In Vitro Replicative Cycle.
LID - 8135 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158135 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection causes several disorders, and
      acyclovir is used as a reference compound. However, resistant strains are
      commonly observed. Herein, we investigate the effects of N-heterocyclic compounds
      (pyrazolopyridine derivatives), named ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57, on HSV-1 in
      vitro replication. We show that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of 
      the compounds ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57 were 1.00 +/- 0.10, 1.00 +/- 0.05, and
      0.70 +/- 0.10 microM, respectively. These compounds presented high 50% cytotoxic 
      concentration (CC50) values, which resulted in a selective index (SI) of 1000,
      1000, and 857.1 for ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57, respectively. To gain insight into
      which step of the HSV-1 replication cycle these molecules would impair, we
      performed adsorption and penetration inhibition assays and time-of-addition
      experiments. Our results indicated that ARA-04 and ARA-05 affected viral
      adsorption, while AM-57 interfered with the virus replication during its alpha-
      and gamma-phases and decreased ICP27 content during initial and late events of
      HSV-1 replication. In addition, we also observed that AM-57 caused a strong
      decrease in viral gD content, which was reinforced by in silico calculations that
      suggested AM-57 interacts preferentially with the viral complex between a general
      transcription factor and virion protein (TFIIBc-VP16). In contrast, ARA-04 and
      ARA-05 interact preferentially in the proteins responsible for the viral
      adsorption process (nectin-1 and glycoprotein). Thus, our results suggest that
      the 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives inhibit the HSV-1 replicative cycle
      with a novel mechanism of action, and its scaffold can be used as a template for 
      the synthesis of promising new molecules with antiviral effects, including to
      reinforce the presented data herein for a limited number of molecules.

TI  - Seasonal Patterns and Trends in Dermatoses in Poland.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158934 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The amount of data available online is constantly increasing,
      including search behavior and tracking trends in domains such as Google.
      Analyzing the data helps to predict patient needs and epidemiological events more
      accurately. Our study aimed to identify dermatology-related terms that occur
      seasonally and any search anomalies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: The 
      data were gathered using Google Trends, with 69 entries between January-2010 and 
      December-2020 analyzed. We conducted the Seasonal Mann-Kendal Test to determine
      the strength of trends. The month with the highest seasonal component (RSV) and
      the lowest seasonal component (RSV) was indicated for every keyword. Groups of
      keywords occurring together regularly at specific periods of the year were shown.
      RESULTS: We found that some topics were seasonally searched in winter (e.g.,
      herpes, scabies, candida) and others in summer (e.g., erythema, warts,
      urticaria). CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, downward trends in searches on sexually
      transmitted diseases in comparison with increased infection rates reported
      officially show a strong need for improved sexual education in Poland. There were
      no significant differences in trends for coronavirus-related cutaneous symptoms
      during 2020. We have shown that the seasonality of dermatologically related terms
      searched in Poland via Google did not differ significantly during SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic.

PG  - eabo4435
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo4435 [doi]
AB  - Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a life-long infection spread by oral
      contact, infects a majority of adults globally. Phylogeographic clustering of
      sampled diversity into European, pan-Eurasian, and African groups has suggested
      the virus codiverged with human migrations out of Africa, although a much younger
      origin has also been proposed. We present three full ancient European HSV-1
      genomes and one partial genome, dating from the 3rd to 17th century CE, sequenced
      to up to 9.5x with paired human genomes up to 10.16x. Considering a dataset of
      modern and ancient genomes, we apply phylogenetic methods to estimate the age of 
      sampled modern Eurasian HSV-1 diversity to 4.68 (3.87 to 5.65) ka. Extrapolation 
      of estimated rates to a global dataset points to the age of extant sampled HSV-1 
      as 5.29 (4.60 to 6.12) ka, suggesting HSV-1 lineage replacement coinciding with
      the late Neolithic period and following Bronze Age migrations.

LID - 10.1556/650.2022.32559 [doi]
AB  - The Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis) is an
      autolimited process, which can be caused by viral agents like Epstein-Barr virus,
      human herpes virus, HIV, B19 parvovirus, paromyxoviruses, SARS-CoV-2, Toxoplasma 
      and Yersinia. The correct diagnosis is based on histological findings. A
      45-year-old female patient presented in our ambulatory room with a unilateral
      neck mass, fever, dysphonia and dysphagia. The patient was double-tested positive
      for SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1 month before the symptoms started. Before
      examination, the nasopharyngeal rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 resulted negative.
      After hospitalization, intravenous antibiotic (Augmentin, 3 x 1.2 g; Klion, 2 x
      100 mg) and steroid (Solu-Medrol, 2 x 125 mg) therapy were administered. The neck
      and chest CT described a right-sided retropharyngeal abscess with bilateral neck 
      lympadenopathy. Urgent tracheotomy, neck dissection and lymph node biopsy were
      made. The intraoperative findings excluded the presence of the abscess. The
      histological findings confirmed the necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis.
      Despite of the fact that the Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is autolimited, we can see 
      that, in this particular case, the lymphadenopathy after the SARS-CoV-2 infection
      caused a life-threatening situation. The formed extratissular liquid imitated the
      image of a retropharyngeal abscess. In the searched worldwide literature, similar
      intervention for this type of process was not described. Tracheotomy, neck
      dissection and removing the lymph nodes as ,,trigger zones" caused the full
      recovery of the patient. In the future, we consider important proving and
      clarifying the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Orv

TI  - The Composites of Polyamide 12 and Metal Oxides with High Antimicrobial Activity.
LID - 3025 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14153025 [doi]
AB  - The lack of resistance of plastic objects to various pathogens and their
      increasing activity in our daily life have made researchers develop polymeric
      materials with biocidal properties. Hence, this paper describes the thermoplastic
      composites of Polyamide 12 mixed with 1-5 wt % of the nanoparticles of zinc,
      copper, and titanium oxides prepared by a twin-screw extrusion process and
      injection moulding. A satisfactory biocidal activity of polyamide 12
      nanocomposites was obtained thanks to homogenously dispersed metal oxides in the 
      polymer matrix and the wettability of the metal oxides by PA12. At 4 wt % of the 
      metal oxides, the contact angles were the lowest and it resulted in obtaining the
      highest reduction rate of the Escherichia coli (87%), Candida albicans (53%), and
      Herpes simplex 1 (90%). The interactions of the nanocomposites with the
      fibroblasts show early apoptosis (11.85-27.79%), late apoptosis (0.81-5.04%), and
      necrosis (0.18-0.31%), which confirms the lack of toxicity of used metal oxides. 
      Moreover, the used oxides affect slightly the thermal and rheological properties 
      of PA12, which was determined by oscillatory rheology, thermogravimetric
      analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry.

TI  - Associations between Awareness of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and
      Prevalence of STIs among Sub-Saharan African Men and Women.
LID - 147 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7080147 [doi]
AB  - Treatments for HIV and other STIs are not readily available in sub-Saharan Africa
      and other resource-limited areas, where the prevalence of HIV and other STIs is
      high. In the absence of treatment and laboratory infrastructure to monitor
      treatment efficacy, increasing awareness of STIs and STI screening are crucial
      components of STI prevention programs. In the current study, we sought to
      estimate the awareness of STIs in resource-limited countries and evaluate the
      strength of the association between the awareness of STIs and STIs infection. We 
      did a secondary analysis of data obtained from 2019 women and 794 men enrolled in
      a community-based study that was conducted from November 2002 to March 2003 in
      the Moshi Urban District of Northern Tanzania. We found gonorrhea, syphilis, and 
      HIV/AIDS were well-known among the study participants. However, their awareness
      of other STIs, including herpes, was very low. We also found that the awareness
      of STIs was not associated with STIs in men, but women who had prior knowledge of
      gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV had a twofold higher risk of testing positive for an
      STI. Education programs aimed at increasing awareness of STIs are needed in the
      region. The majority of the existing STI education programs in the region focus
      exclusively on HIV/AIDS. The expansion of the existing AIDS/HIV education
      programs needs to be strengthened to include information about other STIs.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus Seroprevalence among Pregnant Finnish Women and Their
      Spouses-A Six-Year Follow-Up Cohort Study.
LID - 1506 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081506 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to evaluate the herpes simplex virus (HSV) seroprevalence and
      seroconversion among 285 pregnant women and their 120 male spouses in Finland
      during a six-year follow-up (FU) between 1998-2008. We also studied the effect of
      sexual habits, pregnancy, and other demographic factors on the acquisition of HSV
      infection. Combined HSV-1 and HSV-2-IgG antibodies were assessed in the first
      baseline serum samples with an indirect enzyme immunoassay method. The
      individuals with seronegative or borderline HSV serology at baseline were
      additionally tested using their latest FU serum sample available. The overall HSV
      seroprevalence during the FU was 58.9% (168/285) among the women and 53.3%
      (64/120) among their spouses. The seroconversion rate was 11.4% (15/132) and
      12.5% (8/64) among women and their spouses, respectively. Both spouses were HSV
      seropositive in 39.2% (47/120). To determine the HSV-2 seroprevalence, we also
      tested all HSV-seropositive participants using HSV-2-specific antigen. HSV-2
      seropositivity was detected in 10.9% (44/405) of the participants. The age (p =
      0.006) and history of genital warts (p = 0.006) of the women were associated with
      combined HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 seropositivity, while a younger age was related to
      HSV seroconversion (p = 0.023). Among the male spouses, HSV seropositivity was
      associated with the practice of oral sex (p = 0.033). To conclude, women of
      childbearing age acquire primary HSV infections and the presence of HSV in oral
      epithelium is common among HSV-seropositive individuals.

      HSV-TK against lung cancer brain metastases.
PG  - 253-265
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the number of patients with
      intracranial metastases is increasing. Previously, we developed an enzyme prodrug
      suicide gene therapy based on the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
      (HSV-TK)/ganciclovir (GCV) system using various mesenchymal stem cells to induce 
      apoptosis in malignant gliomas through bystander killing effects. Here, we
      describe stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) as gene vehicles
      of the TK/GCV system against a brain metastasis model of non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). We introduced the A168H mutant TK (TK(A168H)) into SHED to
      establish the therapeutic cells because of the latent toxicity of wild type. SHED
      expressing TK(A168H) (SHED-TK) exhibited chemotaxis to the conditioned medium of 
      NSCLC and migrated toward implanted NSCLC in vivo. SHED-TK demonstrated a strong 
      bystander effect in vitro and in vivo and completely eradicated H1299 NSCLC in
      the brain. SHED-TK cells implanted intratumorally followed by GCV administration 
      significantly suppressed the growth of H1299 and improved survival time. These
      results indicate that the TK(A168H) variant is suitable for establishing
      therapeutic cells and that intratumoral injection of SHED-TK followed by GCV
      administration may be a useful strategy for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - In this review, we explore recombination in two very different virus families
      that have become major threats to human health. The Herpesviridae are a large
      family of pathogenic double-stranded DNA viruses involved in a range of diseases 
      affecting both people and animals. Coronaviridae are positive-strand RNA viruses 
      (CoVs) that have also become major threats to global health and economic
      stability, especially in the last two decades. Despite many differences, such as 
      the make-up of their genetic material (DNA vs. RNA) and overall mechanisms of
      genome replication, both human herpes viruses (HHVs) and CoVs have evolved to
      rely heavily on recombination for viral genome replication, adaptation to new
      hosts and evasion of host immune regulation. In this review, we will focus on the
      roles of three viral exonucleases: two HHV exonucleases (alkaline nuclease and
      PolExo) and one CoV exonuclease (ExoN). We will review the roles of these three
      nucleases in their respective life cycles and discuss the state of drug discovery
      efforts against these targets.

TI  - The Epidemiology and Variation in Pseudorabies Virus: A Continuing Challenge to
      Pigs and Humans.
LID - 1463 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071463 [doi]
AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect most mammals and is well known for causing
      substantial economic losses in the pig industry. In addition to pigs, PRV
      infection usually leads to severe itching, central nervous system dysfunction,
      and 100% mortality in its non-natural hosts. It should be noted that increasing
      human cases of PRV infection have been reported in China since 2017, and these
      patients have generally suffered from nervous system damage and even death. Here,
      we reviewed the current prevalence and variation in PRV worldwide as well as the 
      PRV-caused infections in animals and humans, and briefly summarized the vaccines 
      and diagnostic methods used for pseudorabies control. Most countries, including
      China, have control programs in place for pseudorabies in domestic pigs, and
      thus, the disease is on the decline; however, PRV is still globally epizootic and
      an important pathogen for pigs. In countries where pseudorabies in domestic pigs 
      have already been eliminated, the risk of PRV transmission by infected wild
      animals should be estimated and prevented. As a member of the alphaherpesviruses,
      PRV showed protein-coding variation that was relatively higher than that of
      herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and its
      evolution was mainly contributed to by the frequent recombination observed
      between different genotypes or within the clade. Recombination events have
      promoted the generation of new variants, such as the variant strains resulting in
      the outbreak of pseudorabies in pigs in China, 2011. There have been 25 cases of 
      PRV infections in humans reported in China since 2017, and they were considered
      to be infected by PRV variant strains. Although PRV infections have been
      sporadically reported in humans, their causal association remains to be
      determined. This review provided the latest epidemiological information on PRV
      for the better understanding, prevention, and treatment of pseudorabies.

TI  - Silent Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus in Pregnancy: Implications for
      Maintenance of Immunity to Varicella.
LID - 1438 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071438 [doi]
AB  - We encountered two cases of varicella occurring in newborn infants. Because the
      time between birth and the onset of the illness was much shorter than the
      varicella incubation period, the cases suggested that the infection was
      maternally acquired, despite the fact that neither mother experienced clinical
      zoster. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that VZV frequently reactivates
      asymptomatically in late pregnancy. The appearance of DNA-encoding VZV genes in
      saliva was used as an indicator of reactivation. Saliva was collected from 5
      women in the first and 14 women in the third trimesters of pregnancy and analyzed
      at two different sites, at one using nested PCR and at the other using
      quantitative PCR (qPCR). No VZV DNA was detected at either site in the saliva of 
      women during the first trimester; however, VZV DNA was detected in the majority
      of samples of saliva (11/12 examined by nested PCR; 7/10 examined by qPCR) during
      the third trimester. These observations suggest that VZV reactivation occurs
      commonly during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is possible that this
      phenomenon, which remains in most patients below the clinical threshold, provides
      an endogenous boost to immunity and, thus, is beneficial.

TI  - Tryptophan Residues Are Critical for Portal Protein Assembly and Incorporation in
      Bacteriophage P22.
LID - 1400 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071400 [doi]
AB  - The oligomerization and incorporation of the bacteriophage P22 portal protein
      complex into procapsids (PCs) depends upon an interaction with scaffolding
      protein, but the region of the portal protein that interacts with scaffolding
      protein has not been defined. In herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), conserved
      tryptophan residues located in the wing domain are required for
      portal-scaffolding protein interactions. In this study, tryptophan residues (W)
      present at positions 41, 44, 207 and 211 within the wing domain of the
      bacteriophage P22 portal protein were mutated to both conserved and non-conserved
      amino acids. Substitutions at each of these positions were shown to impair portal
      function in vivo, resulting in a lethal phenotype by complementation. The alanine
      substitutions caused the most severe defects and were thus further characterized.
      An analysis of infected cell lysates for the W to A mutants revealed that all the
      portal protein variants except W211A, which has a temperature-sensitive
      incorporation defect, were successfully recruited into procapsids. By charge
      detection mass spectrometry, all W to A mutant portal proteins were shown to form
      stable dodecameric rings except the variant W41A, which dissociated readily to
      monomers. Together, these results suggest that for P22 conserved tryptophan,
      residues in the wing domain of the portal protein play key roles in portal
      protein oligomerization and incorporation into procapsids, ultimately affecting
      the functionality of the portal protein at specific stages of virus assembly.

TI  - Rare Adverse Events Associated with BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech): A
      Review of Large-Scale, Controlled Surveillance Studies.
LID - 1067 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071067 [doi]
AB  - Given the increasing anti-vaccine movements erroneously touting vaccine danger,
      this review has investigated the rare adverse events potentially associated with 
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), an mRNA vaccine against the severe acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Only real-world surveillance
      studies with at least 0.1 million BNT162b2-vaccinated participants and one
      unvaccinated control group were selected for review. A total of 21 studies
      examining the potential association of BNT162b2 with cardiovascular, herpetic,
      thrombotic or thrombocytopenic, neurological, mortality, and other miscellaneous 
      rare adverse events were described in this review. Only myocarditis is
      consistently associated with BNT162b2. An unclear direction of association was
      seen with stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), herpes zoster, and paresthesia from 
      BNT162b2, which may require more studies to resolve. Fortunately, most
      surveillance studies detected no increased risks of the remaining rare adverse
      events reviewed herein, further reassuring the safety of BNT162b2. In conclusion,
      this review has concisely summarized the current rare adverse events related and 
      unrelated to BNT162b2, arguably for the first time in sufficient depth, to better
      communicate vaccine safety to the public.

TI  - 4-Hydroxybenzoic Acid as an Antiviral Product from Alkaline Autoxidation of
      Catechinic Acid: A Fact to Be Reviewed.
LID - 1822 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141822 [doi]
AB  - The dark brown mixture resulting from the autooxidation of catechinic acid (CA)
      (AOCA) has been reported to possess antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex
      Virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Unfortunately, the constituents of AOCA were not
      separated or identified and the compound(s) responsible for AOCA's antiviral
      activity remained unknown until recently. Colorless 4-hydroxy benzoic acid
      (4-HBA) has been reported as the main constituent (75%) of AOCA, and as being
      responsible for its antiviral activity. The findings seem not to be reliable
      because of the existence in the literature of very different findings, the high
      concentration that was attributed to the supposed 4-HBA in the dark mixture, and 
      the insufficient or inaccurately interpreted analytical experiments reported in
      the study identifying 4-HBA in AOCA. Of particular concern is the lack of AOCA
      chromatograms highlighting a peak attributable to 4-HBA, using commercial 4-HBA
      as a standard, and investigations concerning the antiviral activity of marketed
      4-HBA. Therefore, in this study, to verify the exactness of the recent reports,
      we prepared CA from catechin and AOCA from CA, and the absence of 4-HBA in the
      mixture was first established by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and then was
      confirmed by UHPLC-MS/MS, UV-Vis, and ATR-FTIR analyses. For further
      confirmation, the ATR-FTIR spectral data were processed by principal components
      analysis (PCA), which unequivocally established strong structural differences
      between 4-HBA and AOCA. Finally, while the antiviral effects of AOCA against
      HSV-2 were confirmed, a commercial sample of 4-HBA was completely inactive.

AB  - Pain and itch are both important manifestations of various disorders, such as
      herpes zoster, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Growing evidence suggests that
      both sensations have shared mediators, overlapping neural circuitry, and
      similarities in sensitization processes. In fact, pain and itch coexist in some
      disorders. Determining pharmaceutical agents and targets for treating pain and
      itch concurrently is of scientific and clinical relevance. Here we review the
      neurobiology of pain and itch and discuss the pharmaceutical targets as well as
      novel compounds effective for the concurrent treatment of these sensations.

TI  - Aspects of Antiviral Strategies Based on Different Phototherapy Approaches: Hit
      by the Light.
LID - 858 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070858 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which caused the
      COVID-19 pandemic spreading around the world from late 2019, served as a ruthless
      reminder of the threat viruses pose to global public health. The synthesis of new
      antiviral drugs, as well as repurposing existing products, is a long-term ongoing
      process which has challenged the scientific community. One solution could be an
      effective, accessible, and rapidly available antiviral treatment based on
      phototherapy (PT). PT has been used to treat several diseases, and relies on the 
      absorption of light by endogenous molecules or exogenous photosensitizers (PS).
      PT has often been used in cancer treatment and prophylaxis, and as a complement
      to established chemotherapy and immunotherapy in combined therapeutic strategy.
      Besides significant applications in anticancer treatment, studies have
      demonstrated the beneficial impact of PT on respiratory, systemic, emerging, and 
      oncogenic viral infections. The aim of this review was to highlight the potential
      of PT to combat viral infections by summarizing current progress in photodynamic,
      photothermal, and photoacoustic approaches. Attention is drawn to the virucidal
      effect of PT on systemic viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus and
      human herpes viruses, including the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, human
      herpes virus (HHV8). PT has good potential for disinfection in anti-norovirus
      research and against pandemic viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

      against Herpes Simplex Virus-2.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071462 [doi]
AB  - About half a billion people worldwide are infected with herpes simplex virus-2
      (HSV-2). Prolonged treatment with acyclovir (ACV) and its analogs leads to the
      development of resistant strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      antiviral potential of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from Camellia sinensis and
      a stable analog EGCG-stearate (EGCG-S) against HSV-2 in cultured Vero cells. Cell
      viability and cell proliferation assays were used to determine the non-cytotoxic 
      concentrations on cultured Vero cells. HSV-2 with a green fluorescent protein
      (GFP) fusion protein of VP26 virions were treated with non-cytotoxic
      concentrations of EGCG and EGCG-S. The effects on infectivity and mechanisms were
      determined by plaque assay, attachment and penetration assays, confocal
      microscopy, qPCR, and in silico modeling analysis. Our results demonstrate that
      treatment of HSV-2 virions with EGCG and EGCG-S at a concentration of 75 microM
      showed greater than 99.9% inhibition by inhibiting the attachment of HSV-2
      virions to host cells. The bioinformatic analysis indicated high binding affinity
      of EGCG-S for glycoprotein D; thus EGCG-S may block fusion of HSV-2 and the cell 
      membrane, preventing entry of HSV-2 into the cell.

      including Salmollelosis and herpes zoster infection. Her condition stabilized
      after long-term antimycobacterial treatment. Nevertheless, neutralizing
      anti-interferon-gamma autoantibody was found in her serum, which was compatible
      with the scenario of adult-onset immunodeficiency.

AB  - Rashes and skin lesions are a common reason for patient visits to emergency
      departments and physicians' offices. The differential diagnosis includes a
      variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases, some of which can be
      life-threatening. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the
      quantity and type of skin lesions among outpatients and inpatients at a tertiary 
      care university-affiliated teaching hospital for infectious diseases over a
      three-year period to assess disease burden and physicians' experience in
      diagnosing skin lesions. Diagnoses (by ICD-10 codes) were classified into three
      groups: infectious diseases that include skin lesions, non-infectious skin
      lesions and undiagnosed skin lesions. During the observed period, out of the
      total of 142,416 outpatients, 14.8% presented with some form of skin lesion.
      Among them, 68% had skin lesions inherent to infectious disease, 10.8% suffered
      from non-infectious skin lesions and 21.2% remained with undiagnosed skin
      lesions. The most common infectious diagnoses were chickenpox, herpes zoster and 
      unspecified viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions.
      The most common non-infectious diagnoses were urticaria and atopic dermatitis.
      Overall, the most common individual diagnosis (ICD-10 code) was "nonspecific skin
      eruption" (n = 4448, 21.1%), which was followed by chickenpox and herpes zoster. 
      Among the 17,401 patients hospitalized over the observed period, 13.1% had skin
      lesion as the main reason for hospitalization, almost all (97.5%) of which were
      infectious in etiology. The most common diagnoses were cellulitis, erysipelas and
      herpes zoster. The presented data suggest that the burden of diseases presenting 
      with skin lesions is significant in everyday infectious disease practice, but the
      overwhelming number of undiagnosed patients implies the need for further
      education in this area.

TI  - Comparing Prodrugs with Acyclovir for Treating Postherpetic Neuralgia among
      Herpes Zoster Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 1181 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071181 [doi]
AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, painful, and long-term complication of 
      herpes zoster (HZ). PHN increases the demand for healthcare services and,
      previous studies showed that patients who received antiviral agents were less
      likely to develop PHN. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of
      prodrugs and acyclovir in treating PHN among patients with HZ. The search
      included the PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Center of Register of
      Controlled Trails databases through February 2022. Clinical trials and randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) involving antiviral agent intervention for HZ patients
      diagnosed with PHN were eligible for inclusion. A meta-analysis was conducted to 
      calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with a
      fix-effect model. Five RCTs with 1147 HZ patients met our eligibility criteria.
      Our meta-analysis found that there was a significantly lower risk of PHN for
      members of the prodrugs group (famciclovir and valaciclovir) compared with those 
      who received acyclovir (RR = 0.86, 95%, CI: 0.75 to 0.98, p = 0.03). The review
      of studies indicated that the efficacy of prodrugs was better than acyclovir for 
      reliving PHN.

TI  - Genetic characterization of varicella-zoster and HIV-1 viruses from the
      cerebrospinal fluid of a co-infected encephalitic patient, Ghana.
PG  - 122

AB  - BACKGROUND: Encephalitis is a serious disease of the brain characterized by
      prodromal and specific neurological symptoms. HIV infections offer opportunistic 
      viruses, such as Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the chance to cause encephalitis
      in patients. There is a lack of information on the genetic diversity of VZV in
      Ghana and other parts of Africa which requires sequencing and characterization
      studies to address. The active evolution of HIV-1 in West Africa also requires
      continuous surveillance for the emergence of new genetic forms. CASE
      PRESENTATION: VZV was detected in the CSF sample of an 11-year-old patient
      presenting with symptoms of encephalitis by real-time PCR diagnostics. To
      identify possible unknown aetiological pathogens, next-generation sequencing was 
      performed, and revealed an HIV-1 co-infection. Alignments of concatenated HIV-1
      genome fragments in the gag, pol, vif, env and nef regions and a near-complete
      VZV genome were analyzed by Bayesian inference, and phylogenetic trees were
      generated. The VZV sequence belongs to clade 5 and the HIV-1 sequence is a member
      of the CRF02_AG predominant circulating recombinant form in Ghana. CONCLUSIONS:
      Diagnostic tests for CSF HIV would be useful where possible in patients
      presenting with encephalitis due to VZV and other opportunistic viruses in Kumasi
      to shed light on the role of HIV in encephalitis cases in Ghana. This report
      reaffirms the role of the CRF02_AG circulating recombinant form in HIV infections
      in Ghana and also gives a preliminary genetic characterization of VZV in Kumasi, 
      Ghana.

AB  - Taurine haloamines, N-chlorotaurine (NCT, TauCl), and N-bromotaurine (NBT, TauBr)
      are formed by a reaction between taurine and hypohalous acids, HOCl and HOBr,
      respectively. The major source of endogenous taurine haloamines is neutrophils.
      Both NCT and NBT share strong anti-inflammatory and microbicidal activities
      supported by an absence of microbial resistance. In the light of these
      properties, a number of clinical studies have been performed to document their
      effectiveness in treatment of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. The
      administration of NCT and NBT has been limited to topical application, as they
      are decomposed upon systemic delivery. This review summarizes current knowledge
      concerning the therapeutic use of NCT and NBT mainly in various skin disorders
      such as non-healing wounds, acne vulgaris, herpes zoster, and psoriasis.
      Moreover, the beneficial effect of NCT inhalation in early stages of COVID-19 and
      other viral respiratory infections is discussed. And finally, we would like to
      suggest that NCT might be used to inhibit the development of the cytokine storm
      through its capacity to suppress the production of IL-6.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Headache is one of the most frequent reasons for medical
      consultation. The SUNCT type is classified as a primary trigeminal-autonomic
      headache and should be considered in cases of short-lasting, hemifacial pain
      associated with autonomic dysfunction. Additionally, in the approach to this
      disease, secondary causes that facilitate its onset must be ruled out. CASE
      REPORT: We describe a case of a new-onset SUNCT-type headache in which
      involvement of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve due to herpes zoster
      virus infection was documented six days after the onset of pain. CONCLUSION:
      Trigeminal autonomic headaches are usually primary; yet, multiple conditions have
      been described that are associated with SUNCT-type headaches and have a secondary
      etiology. Among these, herpes zoster virus infection should be considered at the 
      onset of episodes consistent with SUNCT-type headache unresponsive to medical
      treatment.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of antiviral activity of Shouchella clausii probiotic strain 
      and bacterial supernatant against herpes simplex virus type 1.
PG  - 522
LID - 10.1007/s00203-022-03137-9 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is an important human neurotropic virus infecting 
      70% of the world population. Due to the emergence of viral resistance via
      mutations in HSV-1 genes and some of the adverse effects of antiviral compounds, 
      there is a growing need for safe, novel, and effective therapeutic and preventive
      strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate for the first time
      the potential antiviral activity of Shouchella clausii probiotic strain and
      bacterial supernatant against HSV-1. The MTT assay was used to determine the
      possible cytotoxicity of the S. clausii and bacterial supernatant. Vero cells
      were treated by S. clausii, bacterial supernatant, and HSV-1 under pre-treatment 
      (incubation of Vero cells with S. clausii then HSV-1 inoculation), pre-incubation
      (mixture of co-incubated HSV-1/S. clausii added to Vero cell), competition
      (adding HSV-1 and S. clausii into Vero cells simultaneously) and post-treatment
      (Vero cells inoculated with HSV-1 then incubated with S. clausii) assays. Viral
      titer reduction (TCID50) and viral DNA relative quantification by real-time PCR
      were measured in each experimental condition. The results indicated that S.
      clausii and its supernatant had the greatest inhibitory activity toward HSV-1 in 
      pre-treatment assay. The HSV-1 titer treated with S. clausii, and bacterial
      supernatant was 3.6 and 2.2 Log10TCID50/mL lower compared to the control (7.66
      Log10TCID50/mL). Results showed an antiviral effect of S. clausii and its
      supernatant. S. clausii could be considered as a novel inhibitor for HSV-1
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In comparison to general trauma patients, loss of skin barrier
      amongst the burns cohort predisposes them to a higher risk of nosocomial
      infections and sepsis, and this often leads to unfavourable morbidity and
      mortality outcomes. PURPOSE: This integrative review aimed to explore existing
      literature to identify risk factors related to nosocomial infections and/or
      sepsis in adult burns patients following hospital admission. METHODS: Electronic 
      searches for journals published between 2007 and 2021 were performed in CINAHL,
      Scopus and Medline, and key journals were hand-searched. Inclusion criteria was: 
      (1) peer-reviewed, primary studies; (2) qualitative, quantitative or
      mixed-methods studies; (3) study participants had sustained burns-related injury 
      and developed nosocomial infections and/or sepsis during the course of
      hospitalisation. Studies were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill
      Program checklists. RESULTS: 15 studies ranging from 'poor' to 'fair' to
      'moderate' quality were included in the final review. Patient factors that
      contributed to the development of nosocomial infections and/ or sepsis included: 
      (1) Full thickness burns; (2) age; (3) % Total Burns Surface Area; and (4) Herpes
      Simplex Virus activation. Several provider-system risk factors were identified by
      'poor' quality studies and further research is required to substantiate those
      findings. DISCUSSION: Findings remained inconclusive due to the lack of 'good'
      quality studies however, there was an overemphasis on patient-related risk
      factors instead of healthcare workers or the system. Future research may focus on
      activation of the latest infection prevention strategies and early enforcement of
      care bundles. Through identification of related risk factors, it may reduce the
      incidence of nosocomial infection and/or sepsis post-burns.

TI  - Benefits of High-Dose Corticosteroid and Antiviral Agent Combination Therapy in
      the Treatment of House-Brackman Grade VI Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.
PG  - e773-e779
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000003582 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few large-scale investigations have been conducted on treatment of
      House-Brackmann grade VI (HB grade VI) Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) patients. We
      compared recovery rates among patients receiving a normal-dose corticosteroid
      (prednisolone [PSL] 60 mg/d) or high-dose corticosteroid (PSL 200 mg/d), both
      with or without an antiviral agents. Recovery rates were also examined based on
      the order of presentation of herpetic vesicles versus facial palsy. STUDY DESIGN:
      Retrospective case review. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total
      of 128 patients with HB grade VI RHS were treated in our department between 1995 
      and 2017. These patients were divided into four treatment groups based on
      corticosteroid dosage and use of an antiviral agent. METHODS: We assessed
      treatment outcomes for HB grade VI patients together with logistic regression
      analysis to investigate factors that can impact treatment outcomes, that is, sex,
      age, days to start of treatment, PSL dosage, and antiviral agent administration. 
      RESULTS: Recovery rates were best in the high-dose corticosteroid group with an
      antiviral agent (71.1%) in comparison with the normal-dose corticosteroid group
      with an antiviral agent (60.0%) or high-dose corticosteroid alone (57.1%).
      Significant factors for treatment outcomes were high-dose corticosteroid
      administration and early initiation of treatment. A better recovery rate was also
      found when the herpetic vesicles appeared before facial palsy. CONCLUSION: We
      showed that a combination of a high-dose corticosteroid and antiviral agent
      produced the best outcomes for patients with HB grade VI RHS. However, our
      results were not statistically significant because of small sample size.

TI  - Bleb Associated Xen Gel Stent Endophthalmitis: A Case Report and Review of
      Literature.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1080/09273948.2022.2093225 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of a unique late complication of the Xen gel stent,
      stent-related endophthalmitis was preceded by flattening of the bleb. CASE
      REPORT: A 63-year-old female was presented with late-onset endophthalmitis
      preceded by flattening of the bleb two years post-insertion of Xen gel stent.
      B-scan of the posterior chamber revealed vitritis and hyaloid condensation, with 
      no viral, fungal, or bacterial pathologies identified on anterior chamber tap.
      The patient's eye responded to injections of intravitreal antibiotics.
      CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis can occur as late as 2 years after implantation of
      glaucoma drainage device implants (GDIs) like the Xen gel stent if bleb
      flattening or leaking leads to contact of the stent with the conjunctiva.
      Therefore, in case of blebs getting flat, ophthalmologists should watch them more
      often. Intravitreal antibiotics may also be effective rather than surgical
      removal in the case of a non-eroded stent complicated by endophthalmitis.

TI  - Investigating causes and risk factors of pre-chemotherapy viremia in acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia pediatric patients.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-022-01878-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leukemia patients are immune-compromised even before starting
      chemotherapy because the malignant cells invade the bone marrow and destroy WBC
      precursors. Leukemic patients are more susceptible to infection by a wide range
      of microorganisms. Viral infections and reactivations are common and may result
      in severe complications. The aim of this study is to investigate different causes
      of viremia in ALL pediatric patients as well as the clinical and the laboratory
      characteristics associated with viral infections. METHODS: Qualitative real-time 
      PCR was used to detect (polyoma BK, parvo B19 and herpes simplex virus) DNA in
      the blood of ALL patients and routine hospital records were used to provide the
      data of hepatitis B & C virus infection. RESULTS: Polyoma BK was the most common 
      detected virus (51.2%) followed by herpes simplex (30.2%). Viremia by single
      virus was found in 16 (37.2%) cases, while viremia by multiple viruses was found 
      in 15 (34.8%) cases. The most frequent co-detected viruses were herpes simplex
      and polyoma BK (11.6%) followed by herpes simplex, parvo B19 and polyoma BK
      (9.3%). CONCLUSION: There is a high frequency of viremia by single virus and
      viremia by multiple viruses at the time of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia in pediatric patients admitted to South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI)
      compared to studies in other regions. Polyoma BK is the most common detected
      virus and is mainly associated with lymphopenia. It was also significantly
      associated with herpes simplex viremia. HCV infection was associated with
      increased incidence of CNS leukemia.

TI  - Positioning of tofacitinib in treatment of ulcerative colitis: a global
      perspective.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/17474124.2022.2106216 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tofacitinib has emerged as a useful drug for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). AREAS COVERED: There is an unmet need for
      cost-effective, non-immunogenic drugs with a safe adverse effect profile to treat
      patients with ulcerative colitis. In the present review, we evaluate the
      available literature to inform the appropriate positioning of tofacitinib in the 
      current drug landscape and identify subsets where its use should be done with
      caution. EXPERT OPINION: Tofacitinib is helpful in the treatment of patients
      where the standard conventional or biological therapies have failed or were not
      tolerated. With lower costs of the generic drug than the biologicals (or
      biosimilars), it could be an important therapy in low- to middle-income
      countries. The risk of infections, especially Herpes Zoster and tuberculosis,
      needs to be addressed before initiation. Tofacitinib should be avoided in
      patients with venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Due
      to limited evidence, the use is not recommended in pregnancy, while it should be 
      used with caution in elderly citizens. Future trials should look into the
      head-to-head comparison of tofacitinib with biologicals. The role of tofacitinib 
      in acute severe colitis needs evaluation with comparative trials with current
      standards of care.

TI  - Sex Differences in the Role of Neurexin 3alpha in Zoster Associated Pain.
PG  - 915797
LID - 10.3389/fnint.2022.915797 [doi]
AB  - Varicella zoster virus (VZV) induces orofacial pain and female rats show greater 
      pain than male rats. During the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle the VZV
      induce pain response is attenuated in female rats. A screen of gene expression
      changes in diestrus and proestrus female rats indicated neurexin 3alpha
      (Nrxn3alpha) was elevated in the central amygdala of proestrus rats vs. diestrus 
      rats. GABAergic neurons descend from the central amygdala to the lateral
      parabrachial region and Nrxn3alpha is important for presynaptic
      gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Thus, we hypothesized that the reduced
      orofacial pain in male rats and proestrus female rats is the result of increased 
      Nrxn3alpha within the central amygdala that increases GABA release from axon
      terminals within the parabrachial and inhibits ascending pain signals. To test
      this hypothesis Nrxn3 alpha expression was knocked-down by infusing shRNA
      constructs in the central amygdala. Then GABA release in the parabrachial was
      quantitated concomitant with measuring the pain response. Results revealed that
      knockdown of Nrxn3alpha expression significantly increases the pain response in
      both male rats and proestrus female rats vs. diestrus rats. GABA release was
      significantly reduced in the parabrachial of male and proestrus female rats after
      Nrxn3alpha knockdown. Neuronal activity of excitatory neurons was significantly
      inhibited in the parabrachial after Nrxn3alpha knockdown. These results are
      consistent with the idea that Nrxn3 within the central amygdala controls VZV
      associated pain by regulating GABA release in the lateral parabrachial that then 
      modulates ascending orofacial pain signals.

TI  - Antibodies to Human Herpesviruses and Rate of Incident Cardiovascular Events and 
      All-Cause Mortality in the UK Biobank Infectious Disease Pilot Study.
PG  - ofac294
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac294 [doi]
AB  - Background: Associations between human herpesviruses (HHVs) and cardiovascular
      disease/mortality have been reported, but evidence is inconsistent. We
      investigated associations between 3 common herpesviruses and (1) incident stroke 
      or myocardial infarction (MI) and (2) all-cause mortality. Methods: We included
      participants from the UK Biobank Infectious Disease pilot study with valid serum 
      antibody (IgG) measurements taken at cohort entry (2006-2010) for herpes simplex 
      virus type 1 (HSV1), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
      Linked hospital and mortality records up to December 30 2019 provided information
      on rates of (1) incident first stroke or MI and (2) all-cause mortality. Hazard
      ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess 
      relationships between (1) HHV seropositivity, (2) HHV titer and incident
      stroke/MI, and death outcomes. Fully adjusted models accounted for
      sociodemographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, education, deprivation
      quintile, birthplace, population density), baseline comorbidities (including
      diabetes and hypertension), smoking status, body mass index, and serum
      cholesterol. Results: Of 9429 study participants (56% female, 95% White, median
      age 58 years), 41% were seropositive for all 3 HHVs. Human herpesvirus
      seropositivity was not associated with stroke/MI (fully adjusted HRs and 95%
      confidence intervals [CIs]: HSV1 = 0.93 [CI, 0.72-1.22], VZV = 0.78 [CI,
      0.51-1.20], CMV = 0.91 [CI, 0.71-1.16]) or all-cause mortality (HSV1 = 1.21 [CI, 
      1.00-1.47], VZV = 0.79 [CI, 0.58-1.07], CMV = 0.90 [CI, 0.76-1.06]). Human
      herpesvirus titers were not associated with outcomes. Conclusions: In this mostly
      White UK Biobank subset, neither HHV seropositivity nor titers were associated
      with stroke/MI or all-cause mortality.

TI  - Correlation of histopathological patterns of OSCC patients with tumor site and
      habits.
PG  - 305
LID - 10.1186/s12903-022-02336-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oral cancer is considered a major global public health problem. The
      causes of OSCC are tobacco, alcohol, viral infections such as EBV, HPV, and
      herpes simplex virus, poor oral hygiene (including sharp teeth and decay),
      ill-fitting denture, ultraviolet (UV) exposure, nutrition, and genetic
      predisposition. The etiology of oral cancer varies in different populations due
      to area-specific etiological factors. OBJECTIVE: Finding a correlation of
      histopathological pattern to the tumor site and habits as an outcome of OSCC.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. A total
      of 100 known cases of an oral squamous cell carcinoma were diagnosed with the
      help of biopsy reports and were examined for histopathologic features, site of
      the lesion, and risk habits. RESULTS: 48 years was the mean age at the time of
      diagnosis with a distribution of 61% men and 39% women. The frequently affected
      site was buccal mucosa and the prime risk habit was gutka followed by betel quid.
      Histologically, the degree of differentiation shows that moderately
      differentiated OSCC was most commonly present, while the most prevalent
      histopathological pattern was spindle cell carcinoma. The statistical relation
      between lesion site and tobacco habits was found to be significant with a p value
      (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma are higher in males
      than females with a mean age at the time of diagnosis being less than 50 years.
      Frequently placing gutka in the buccal vestibule against buccal mucosa is
      responsible to make buccal mucosa the most common tumor site. This study provides
      baseline information regarding habits.

      trial of the anti-herpes simplex virus monoclonal antibody HDIT101 in healthy
      volunteers.
LID - 10.1111/cts.13365 [doi]
AB  - HDIT101 is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody recognizing a conserved
      epitope in glycoprotein B, a target present on the surface of herpes simplex
      virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 particles as well as on virus-infected cells. This was 
      a first-in-human, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 24
      healthy volunteers, randomized 3:1 (placebo:active) in each of the six dose
      levels with escalating doses up to 12,150 mg HDIT101. HDIT101 was administered
      intravenously, to study safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and immunogenicity.
      HDIT101 was well-tolerated in all recipients and no serious or severe adverse
      events, no infusion-related reactions, and no events suggestive of dose limiting 
      off-target toxicity occurred. The mean serum exposure (area under the curve from 
      zero to infinity [AUC0-infinity ]) of HDIT101 showed a linear increase from 4340 
      h*mug/ml at a dose of 50 mg to 1,122,247 h*mug/ml at a dose of 12,150 mg. No
      immunogenic effects following HDIT101 exposure were observed at any of the
      applied doses. HDIT101 demonstrated the expected PK properties of a monoclonal
      antibody was well-tolerated, and could be safely administered even at excessively
      high doses that may be required for treatment of patients with septical HSV
      spread.

AB  - Genital ulcers (GUs) represent a diagnostic challenge and can be secondary to
      neoplastic and inflammatory processes of different causes. Among those of
      infectious etiology, there are sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a very
      frequent reason for seeking the health service. The most common agents are herpes
      simplex virus and Treponema pallidum and, more rarely, Haemophilus ducreyi,
      Klebsiella granulomatis and Chlamydia trachomatis. A careful dermatological
      examination offers important diagnostic elements; however, atypical
      manifestations are very common. Distinctive characteristics of ulcers to look out
      for include their margin, edge, bottom, and base. Regional lymph node chain
      alterations should be evaluated regarding their number, size, mobility,
      consistency, inflammation, and pain on palpation. Diagnostic tests have variable 
      sensitivity and specificity, and molecular tests are currently considered the
      reference exams. The rapid immunochromatographic tests represented a significant 
      advance, as they can be performed with blood obtained from the digital pulp,
      offer results in up to 30 minutes, and do not require a laboratory structure. The
      treatment of persons affected by GU/STIs must be immediate, as it aims to prevent
      complications, as well as reduce transmission. It is not always considered that
      people with GUs/STIs have varying degrees of depression, anxiety, and
      self-reproach, with an impact on relationships. Establishing a bond and trusting 
      the professional is essential for adherence to treatment and preventive measures 
      that must be discussed individually.

TI  - Mucocutaneous manifestations and their relationship with CD4 T-lymphocyte count
      in hospitalized patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 
      Medellin, Colombia
PG  - 278-289
LID - 10.7705/biomedica.6117 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: About 80-95% of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) develop skin manifestations, which are markers of the patients'
      immune status. Objective: To describe the dermatologic manifestations and the
      clinical and sociodemographic factors of hospitalized patients diagnosed with HIV
      and their correlation with CD4 T-lymphocyte count. Materials and methods: We
      conducted an observational, cross-sectional, and retrospective study of the
      medical records of 227 adult patients with HIV diagnosis evaluated by dermatology
      in a hospital in Medellin, Colombia. Results: We included 227 patient records
      with 433 dermatologic manifestations, 64.4% of them infectious. The most frequent
      manifestations were oral candidiasis, condylomata acuminata, and drug reactions. 
      Moreover, a statistically significant relationship was found between disseminated
      herpes zoster virus and secondary syphilis with a CD4 count between 200-499
      cells/mm3 (p=0.04 and 0.028, respectively). There was also a statistically
      significant relationship between oral candidiasis and a CD4 count of less than
      100 cells/mm3 (p=0.008). Conclusions: The relationship between disseminated
      herpes zoster with CD4 between 200-499 cells/mm3 suggests that, despite having
      high CD4 counts, severe forms of the disease may occur due to possible T-cell
      dysfunction and depletion of the immune system. Additionally, the relationship
      between oral candidiasis and CD4 less than 100 cells/mm3 indicates the potential 
      role of oral candidiasis as an essential marker of weakened immune status in HIV 
      patients.

TI  - Infectious diseases and cognition: do we have to worry?
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06280-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Age-related physiological changes, particularly immune system
      decline, may contribute to greater vulnerability to infectious diseases in older 
      individuals. A growing body of evidence shows that both, acute, and chronic
      infections may be accompanied by cognitive disturbances as part of their
      manifestations. Given the importance of cognition in aging trajectories, the
      objective of this article was to review current knowledge on cognitive outcomes
      of infectious diseases in older adults, and to emphasize the importance of
      considering cognition as a domain of interest in its own rights in these
      diseases. METHODS: A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was conducted to identify
      articles reporting cognitive impairment associated with various severe acute
      infections and specific chronic infectious conditions such as human immune
      deficiency virus, the herpes virus family, hepatitis C virus, Lyme borreliosis,
      Helicobacter pylori, periodontitis, and emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, as
      well as potentially preventive strategies like vaccination. RESULTS/ CONCLUSIONS:
      Taken together, the studies examined in the present review emphasize that
      numerous acute and chronic infectious diseases share mechanisms that, when added 
      to specific risk factors frequently found in older persons, contribute to
      considerably increase the risk of cognitive outcomes such as cognitive decline
      and dementia. This review may help to appreciate the role that infectious
      diseases play in cognitive trajectories and thus promote further investigation on
      the topic.

AB  - The zebrafish is an important model in systems neuroscience but viral tools to
      dissect the structure and function of neuronal circuitry are not established. We 
      developed methods for efficient gene transfer and retrograde tracing in adult and
      larval zebrafish by herpes simplex viruses (HSV1). HSV1 was combined with the
      Gal4/UAS system to target cell types with high spatial, temporal, and molecular
      specificity. We also established methods for efficient transneuronal tracing by
      modified rabies viruses in zebrafish. We demonstrate that HSV1 and rabies viruses
      can be used to visualize and manipulate genetically or anatomically identified
      neurons within and across different brain areas of adult and larval zebrafish. An
      expandable library of viruses is provided to express fluorescent proteins,
      calcium indicators, optogenetic probes, toxins and other molecular tools. This
      toolbox creates new opportunities to interrogate neuronal circuits in zebrafish
      through combinations of genetic and viral approaches.

TI  - A Review of African Medicinal Plants and Functional Foods for the Management of
      Alzheimer's Disease-related Phenotypes, Treatment of HSV-1 Infection and/or
      Improvement of Gut Microbiota.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder is
      the most common form of dementia globally. Several studies have suggested
      alteration in the gut microbiota and HSV-1 infection as contributing factors to
      the development of the disease. As at now, there are no AD attenuating agents and
      AD pharmacotherapy is focused on managing symptoms while plants used in
      ethnomedicine remain potential sources of drugs for the treatment of the
      condition. Here, we reviewed published databases for African ethnomedicinal
      plants and functional foods of African origin that are used in the management of 
      AD-related phenotypes, treatment of herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV-1) and/or
      improvement of gut microbiota. A total of 101 unique plant species and 24
      different types of traditionally prepared African functional foodstuff were
      identified. Of the 101 identified plant species, 50 species serve as functional
      foodstuffs. Twenty-three (23) of the ethnomedicinal plant families were
      successfully identified for the treatment and management of AD-related phenotypes
      and age-related dementia. Eighteen (18) African plant species from 15 families
      were also identified as potent remedies for HSV-1; while many African wild fruits
      (3 species), roots and tubers (7 species), leafy vegetables (14 species), and
      seaweeds (26 species) were functional foods for modifying AD-related phenotypes. 
      It was concluded that African medicinal plants are potential sources of both AD
      attenuating agents and phytocompounds that may be used against HSV-1 infection
      and alteration of gut microbiota. Additionally, a number of African functional
      foods are important sources of prebiotics and probiotics.

AB  - Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally. Growing scientific
      evidence indicated that inflammation of the trabecular meshwork induced by
      corneal endotheliitis could lead to secondary glaucoma. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has
      been identified as the most common herpes virus in corneal endotheliitis
      patients. Early detection is critical in preventing endothelial cell loss, and
      patient management should vary based on different pathological factors. However, 
      routine culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) have difficult in 
      distinguishing whether CMV, Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) or Herpes Simplex Virus 
      (HSV) causes endothiliitis. This may result in inappropriate treatment, which may
      prolong or aggravate the status of disease. We compared the sensitivity and
      specificity of qPCR and Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) in the
      aqueous humor of patients with suspected CMV endotheliitis in this study. Our
      results showed that four out of 11 (36.4%) of our patients were positive for CMV 
      by qPCR, whereas mNGS had a 100% detection rate of CMV. Our findings implied that
      mNGS could be a useful diagnostic tool for CMV-induced endotheliitis.

      HSV-1 can infect certain dendritic cells, which becomes an event in the viral
      strategy to interfere with the host's immune system. We previously generated the 
      HSV-1 mutant strain M6, which produced an attenuated phenotype in mice and rhesus
      monkeys. The attenuated M6 strain was used to investigate how HSV-1 infection of 
      dendritic cells interferes with both innate and adaptive immunity. Our study
      showed that dendritic cells membrane HVEM receptors could mediate infection of
      the wild-type strain and attenuated M6 strain and that dendritic cells infected
      by both viruses in local tissues of animals exhibited changes in transcriptional 
      profiles associated with innate immune and inflammatory responses. The infection 
      of pDCs and cDCs by the two strains promoted cell differentiation to the CD103(+)
      phenotype, but varied transcriptional profiles were observed, implying a strategy
      that the HSV-1 wild-type strain interferes with antiviral immunity, probably due 
      to viral modification of the immunological phenotype of dendritic cells during
      processing and presentation of antigen to T cells, leading to a series of
      deviations in immune responses, ultimately generating the deficient immune
      phenotype observed in infected individuals in the clinical.

AB  - Experiences from clinical practice suggest that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) used as 
      adjuvant treatment can shorten the time to clinical resolution of blepharitis,
      particularly in relation to the ophthalmic complications that often occur with a 
      blepharitis diagnosis. In addition, in clinical practice, HOCl adjuvant treatment
      also resulted in a viable option for the management of ophthalmic disorders other
      than blepharitis. This case series presents and discusses real-life experiences
      with using an HOCl ophthalmic spray to manage eye infections, further
      characterizing the use of HOCl for ophthalmic applications.

TI  - Seropositive Neuromyelitis Optica in a Case of Undiagnosed Ankylosing
      Spondylitis: A Neuro-Rheumatological Conundrum.
PG  - 29

AB  - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune astrocytopathy
      against foot processes of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels. Patients with NMOSD 
      tend to have other coexisting autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. However,
      AQP-4-antibody-positive NMOSD coexisting with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is
      rare. AS is an immune-mediated disorder, a subset of axial spondyloarthropathies,
      which commonly manifests as chronic inflammatory back pain in young people, and
      it has a strong association with HLA-B27. In this study, a 35-year-old Indian man
      with an undiagnosed progressive axial spondyloarthropathy (i.e., AS) is reported 
      presenting with acute-onset longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, a
      clinical subset of NMOSD. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a
      primary demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), is an
      autoimmune astrocytopathy against foot processes of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water
      channels, which manifests with optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive
      transverse myelitis (LETM), area-postrema syndrome, brainstem syndrome
      diencephalic syndrome, and cerebral syndrome.(1-4) Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is
      an immune-mediated disorder, a subset of axial spondyloarthropathies, which
      commonly manifests as chronic inflammatory back pain in young people, and it has 
      a strong association with HLA-B27.(5,6) AS characteristically targets the axial
      skeleton, peripheral joints, entheses (connective tissues between
      tendons/ligaments and bones), and gut.(5,6) Patients with NMOSD tend to have
      other coexisting autoimmune/connective tissue diseases.(7) For example, cases
      with NMOSD and multiple sclerosis, which are other autoimmune primary
      demyelinating disorders of the CNS, have been reported.(8,9) However, concurrent 
      existence of AS and NMOSD in the same patient even over years of disease course
      is rare.(10,11) In addition, studies describing neurological manifestations of AS
      are limited,(12) and they focus on joint inflammation and long-standing bony
      pathology (ankylosis) related to compressive myelopathy, myelo-radiculopathy, and
      cauda equina syndromes.(12,13) The authors present a case of a young Indian man
      with an undiagnosed progressive AS (misdiagnosed and mismanaged by an indigenous 
      medical practitioner) presenting with acute-onset LETM variant of AQP4-positive
      NMOSD. A 35-year-old healthy, non-comorbid man from rural India came to the
      outpatient department with complaints of persistent tingling, numbness, and
      weakness of both lower limbs (right more than left) for 10 days. The clinical
      picture showed acute-onset urinary retention, which was relieved by urinary
      catheterization. An indigenous medical practitioner had prescribed drugs to treat
      a urinary tract infection. His weakness gradually progressed over the following
      week, causing him to become bedridden. During the removal of the catheter, he
      felt urgency, increased frequency of micturition, and overt urinary incontinence.
      He gave no history suggestive of any girdle-like sensations, root/radicular/tract
      pain, vertebral pain, trauma, recent vaccination, and diarrheal or febrile
      illness. For the last 8 months, he had a complaint of an insidious-onset,
      persistent, bilateral, dull aching pain in the gluteal region accompanied by
      low-back pain and morning stiffness up to 1 h, which markedly improved with
      activity and reoccurred following long periods of inactivity. He sometimes had to
      rise in the middle of the night because of excruciating pain, which could be
      relieved after moving around the room and corridors for half an hour. He was
      taking over-the-counter diclofenac tablets for pain relief prescribed by some
      indigenous medical practitioners who told him that it was due to overwork in
      agricultural fields, that is, mechanical back pain. He also had a normal X-ray of
      the lumbosacral spine. He had no addiction liabilities, and none of the family
      members had ever suffered from a similar kind of illness. He had never consulted 
      any trained medical practitioner, as his previous back-pain-related symptoms
      responded well to the tablets prescribed by the indigenous medical
      practitioner(s). During examination, he was found to have recent-onset,
      asymmetric spastic paraparesis (right more than left) with upper motor
      neuron-type urinary bladder symptoms. Cognitive assessment (assessed by the
      Montreal cognitive assessment test) was normal, and posterior column sensations
      were preserved. Sensory system examination revealed no definite sensory level.
      Except for the paretic lower limbs, cerebellar functions were normal in other
      regions. Neuro-ophthalmological examinations were also normal, and no signs of
      meningeal irritation were observed. The history and course of the disease and
      clinical examinations were analyzed. Selective tractopathy (early and predominant
      motor and autonomic tract affection) was suggested for an intramedullary
      demyelinating pathology affecting the anterior central cord. This case was
      initially classified as acute-onset non-compressive myelopathy at the lower
      cervical/upper dorsal region level in a patient with a pre-existing axial
      spondyloarthropathy. Complete blood cell count; liver, kidney, and thyroid
      function tests; and plasma glucose and electrolytes were normal, except for an
      increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (66 mm in the first hour). Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord revealed a demyelinating LETM from C5 
      to D4 level (Figure 1). Meanwhile, an MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed
      bilateral sacroiliitis. Brain and orbital MRIs were devoid of any lesions.
      Anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) antibodies were tested by cell-based assay in serum and 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and both were positive. CSF further revealed
      lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased intrathecal protein production. Visually
      evoked potential recordings were also normal. In addition, anti-myelin
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies were negative. Anti-nuclear antibody
      (ANA), ANA-profile, autoimmune vasculitis profile (c-ANCA, p-ANCA), neurovirus
      panel (i.e., polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes
      simplex viruses 1 and 2, human herpesviruses 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus,
      enteroviruses, varicella-zoster virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue virus), 
      CSF-polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme, anti-phospholipid, and anti-thyroid antibodies
      were negative. Anti-CCP-antibody and rheumatoid factor were also negative,
      including creatine phosphokinase level and serum vitamin B12. Moreover,
      serologies for hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus, and scrub typhus
      were negative. However, HLA-B27 assay was positive. The final diagnosis was
      AQP4-positive NMOSD associated with AS. He was placed on pulse intravenous
      methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days). Consequently, his lower limb power
      improved remarkably. Cyclical rituximab therapy was initiated to prevent
      relapses. At 3-month follow-up, he had no residual neurological deficit except
      for persistence of paresthesias. Neuroimaging and visually evoked potential
      studies revealed no active or new lesions. After 6 months of therapy, a
      subjective and objective improvement was observed in disease severity based on
      the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score. Our patient satisfied the new 
      Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society diagnostic/classification
      criteria for AS and the Wingerchuk criteria for NMOSD,(4,14) an association that 
      has been rarely reported.(10,11) Amid the extra-articular complications of
      long-standing AS, neurological manifestations are considered infrequent.(15)
      However, subclinical neurological complications may be frequent in AS.(12) Common
      neurological manifestations result from bony (vertebral) ankylosis, subluxation
      of joints, ossification of anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments,
      secondary spinal canal stenosis, bony (vertebral) fractures, and subsequent
      compressions over nerve radicles/roots/cauda equina, and inflammation-related
      (entrapment) peripheral neuropathies.(12,16,17) Acute transverse myelitis can
      occur as a subset of several primary demyelinating disorders of the CNS (i.e.,
      multiple sclerosis, NMOSD, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease, 
      and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and various systemic autoimmune
      connective tissue disorders (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective
      tissue disease, Sjogren syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      neurosarcoidosis).(18) Acute transverse myelitis (short or long segment) is an
      infrequent extra-articular complication of AS.(18) It has been reported to evolve
      either as a distinct neurological complication of AS, or it may develop secondary
      to TNF-alpha-inhibitor therapy for the treatment of AS.(18,19) AS is a heritable 
      inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that primarily affects the axial skeleton, which
      is mediated by T-cells; B-cells only play a minor role.(5) On the contrary, the
      key for the pathogenesis of NMOSD is the production of autoantibodies against
      AQP-4 channels expressed on astrocytes, leading to complement-mediated damage,
      with ensuing demyelination. Myelitis usually shows high signal intensity on the
      tbl2-weighted image and contrast enhancement in the spinal cord.(1-4) Despite the
      difference in molecular mechanisms, the diagnosis of these diseases in the same
      individual may not be coincidental. Recent evidence has shown T-cell-mediated
      inflammatory responses in cases of NMOSD.(20) In particular, Th17 and Th2-related
      cytokines are elevated in the CSF of NMO patients.(20) Environmental factors such
      as Escherichia coli have also been proven to aggravate autoimmunity in AS and
      NMOSD (however, body fluid cultures for Escherichia coli, performed in our
      patient, showed similar association, and they were found negative two
      times).(21,22) Although large-scale epidemiological studies investigating the
      underlying pathogenesis related to these diseases are lacking, studies have
      demonstrated an increased incidence of optic neuritis among patients with AS.(23)
      Systemic sclerosis and mixed and undifferentiated connective tissue diseases were
      excluded after expert opinions (from two board-certified rheumatologists and two 
      dermatologists) because of the lack of suggestive clinical findings (e.g.,
      absence of skin thickening, salt-and-pepper appearance, nail changes, Mauskopf
      facies, sclerodactyly, calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's phenomenon, other cutaneous
      manifestations, pulmonary arterial hypertension/interstitial lung disease,
      dysphagia, muscular pain/weakness renal impairments, absence of ANA,
      anti-centromere antibodies, anti-Scl-70, PM-Scl antibodies, anti-ds DNA, PCNA,
      CENP-B, anti-nucleosomes, anti-Smith, anti-U1-RNP, anti-Jo1, anti-Mi2, anti-Ro52,
      anti-La antibodies, and normal C3 and C4 complement levels) (The European League 
      Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology classification
      criteria 2019).(24) Finally, our patient was treated with intravenous steroids
      followed by rituximab infusions, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody directed against
      B-cells. In particular, this patient clinically and radiologically responded to
      immunomodulatory drugs, which might support a possible common pathogenic basis of
      the two processes. TNF-alpha inhibitors are commonly used as novel therapeutics
      in AS; however, they can potentially result in serious complications, that is,
      secondary demyelinating disorders.(25) However, such inhibitors in this patient
      were not used. When used in cases of AS, they show satisfactory results.(25,26)
      Therefore, it was decided to treat him with rituximab only without adding any
      second immunomodulatory. Other possible therapeutic options include
      cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, but they were not used because of
      their low efficacy-safety balance. Moreover, plasmapheresis was not available in 
      our specific setting, despite solid evidence that early treatment with
      therapeutic strategy (5-7 courses) provides good long-term outcomes in patients
      with NMOSD.(27) Therefore, when dealing with a case of acute non-compressive
      myelopathy, history and clinical examination are important to determine the
      potential underlying etiology and identify an undermined systemic disorder with
      apparently unrelated non-specific features. Connective tissue disorders should
      always be considered as a differential diagnosis and be ruled out in all cases of
      either seropositive or seronegative NMOSD. A diagnosis of AS should be considered
      in relevant circumstances when dealing with a case of isolated seronegative LETM.
      Moreover, early diagnosis and treatment of AS are quintessential to prevent
      lifelong distressing disabilities. However, whether patients with AS have any
      extra predilection to develop NMOSD throughout their life requires further
      studies.

AB  - Influenza A viruses, known etiological agents of seasonal outbreaks, epidemics,
      and pandemics, are RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family. They can manifest 
      with a wide range of neurological complications. Influenza related encephalitis
      is rarely reported and poorly characterized in adults. Its diagnosis is hampered 
      by significant variation in clinical presentation and difficulties in virus
      detection in the cerebrospinal fluid. Diffuse brain edema, symmetric involvement 
      of thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum, or normal findings in the acute phase
      followed by the appearance of diffuse low attenuation and mild brain atrophy are 
      reported cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings, but unilateral temporal
      lobe involvement has not been observed before. Here we describe an unusual adult 
      case who presented with new-onset epileptic seizures and unilateral temporal lobe
      lesion mimicking herpes simplex encephalitis but a polymerase chain reaction of
      cerebrospinal fluid confirmed influenza type A associated encephalitis.

TI  - Intratumoral oncolytic herpes virus G47 for residual or recurrent glioblastoma: a
      phase 2 trial.
LID - 10.1038/s41591-022-01897-x [doi]
AB  - This investigator-initiated, phase 2, single-arm trial primarily assessed the
      efficacy of G47, a triple-mutated, third-generation oncolytic herpes simplex
      virus type 1, in 19 adult patients with residual or recurrent, supratentorial
      glioblastoma after radiation therapy and temozolomide (UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial
      Registry UMIN000015995). G47Delta was administered intratumorally and repeatedly 
      for up to six doses. The primary endpoint of 1-yr survival rate after G47
      initiation was 84.2% (95% confidence interval, 60.4-96.6; 16 of 19). The
      prespecified endpoint was met and the trial was terminated early. Regarding
      secondary endpoints, the median overall survival was 20.2 (16.8-23.6) months
      after G47 initiation and 28.8 (20.1-37.5) months from the initial surgery. The
      most common G47-related adverse event was fever (17 of 19) followed by vomiting, 
      nausea, lymphocytopenia and leukopenia. On magnetic resonance imaging,
      enlargement of and contrast-enhancement clearing within the target lesion
      repeatedly occurred after each G47 administration, which was characteristic to
      this therapy. Thus, the best overall response in 2 yr was partial response in one
      patient and stable disease in 18 patients. Biopsies revealed increasing numbers
      of tumor-infiltrating CD4(+)/CD8(+) lymphocytes and persistent low numbers of
      Foxp3(+) cells. This study showed a survival benefit and good safety profile,
      which led to the approval of G47 as the first oncolytic virus product in Japan.

      progressive glioblastoma.
PG  - 4119
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31262-y [doi]
AB  - Here, we report the results of a phase I/II, single-arm study (UMIN-CTR Clinical 
      Trial Registry UMIN000002661) assessing the safety (primary endpoint) of G47, a
      triple-mutated oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, in Japanese adults with
      recurrent/progressive glioblastoma despite radiation and temozolomide therapies. 
      G47Delta was administered intratumorally at 3 x 10(8) pfu (low dose) or 1 x 10(9)
      pfu (set dose), twice to identical coordinates within 5-14 days. Thirteen
      patients completed treatment (low dose, n = 3; set dose, n = 10). Adverse events 
      occurred in 12/13 patients. The most common G47Delta-related adverse events were 
      fever, headache and vomiting. Secondary endpoint was the efficacy. Median overall
      survival was 7.3 (95%CI 6.2-15.2) months and the 1-year survival rate was 38.5%, 
      both from the last G47 administration. Median progression-free survival was 8
      (95%CI 7-34) days from the last G47 administration, mainly due to immediate
      enlargement of the contrast-enhanced area of the target lesion on MRI. Three
      patients survived >46 months. One complete response (low dose) and one partial
      response (set dose) were seen at 2 years. Based on biopsies, post-administration 
      MRI features (injection site contrast-enhancement clearing and entire tumor
      enlargement) likely reflected tumor cell destruction via viral replication and
      lymphocyte infiltration towards tumor cells, the latter suggesting the mechanism 
      for "immunoprogression" characteristic to this therapy. This study shows that
      G47Delta is safe for treating recurrent/progressive glioblastoma and warrants
      further clinical development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be induced upon successful presentation
      of myelin antigens by MHC I/II. Antigenic similarity between the myelin and viral
      proteins may worsen the immunological responses. METHODOLOGY: Antigenic regions
      within myelin proteins; PLP1, MBP, MOG, and MAG were analyzed using SVMTrip and
      EMBOSS. Homology search identified sequence similarity between the predicted host
      epitopes and viral proteins. NetMHCpan predicted MHC I/II binding followed by
      peptide-protein docking through the HPEPDOCK server. Thereafter we analyzed
      conformational flexibility and stability of 15 protein-peptide complexes based on
      high docking scores. The binding free energy was calculated using conventional
      (MD) and Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulation. RESULTS: PLP1, MBP, 
      MAG and MOG contained numerous antigenic epitopes. MBP and MOG epitopes had
      sequence similarity to HHV-6 BALF5; EBNA1 and CMV glycoprotein M (gM), and EBV
      LMP2B, gp350/220; HHV-8 ORFs respectively. Many herpes virus proteins like
      tegument, envelope glycoproteins, and ORFs of EBV, CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-8
      demonstrated sequence similarity with MAG and PLP1. Some antigenic peptides were 
      also linear B-cell epitopes and influenced cytokine production by T-cell. MHC I
      allele HLA-B*57:01 bound to PLP1 peptide and HLA-A*68:02 bound to a MAG peptide
      strongly. MHC II alleles HLA-DRB1*04:05 and HLA-DR1*01:01 associated with MAG-
      and MOG-derived peptides, respectively, demonstrating high HPEPDOCK scores. MD
      simulations established stable binding of certain peptides with the MHC namely
      HLA-B*51:01-MBP(DYKSAHKGFKGVDAQGTLSKIFKL),
      HLA-B*57:01-PLP1(PDKFVGITYALTVVWLLVFACSAVPVYIYF),
      HLA-DR1*01:01-MOG(VEDPFYWVSPGVLVLLAVLPVLLLQITVGLVFLCLQYR) and
      HLA-DRB1*04:05-MAG(TWVQVSLLHFVPTREA). CONCLUSIONS: Cross-reactivity between
      self-antigens and pathogen derived immunodominant epitopes may induce MS. Our
      study supported the role of specific MHC alleles as a contributing MS risk
      factor.

TI  - A Single Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Genome Reactivates from Individual Cells.
PG  - e0114422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01144-22 [doi]
AB  - Latent infection is a characteristic feature of herpesviruses' life cycle. Herpes
      simplex virus 1 is a common human pathogen that establishes lifelong latency in
      peripheral neurons. Symptomatic or asymptomatic periodic reactivations from the
      latent state allow the virus to replicate and spread among individuals. The
      latent viral genomes are found as several quiescent episomes inside the infected 
      nuclei; however, it is not clear if and how many latent genomes are able to
      reactivate together. To address this question, we developed a quiescent infection
      assay, which provides a quantitative analysis of the number of genomes
      reactivating per cell, in cultured immortalized fibroblasts. We found that,
      almost always, only one viral genome reactivates per cell. We showed that
      different timing of entry to quiescence did not result in a significant change in
      the probability of reactivating. Reactivation from this quiescent state allowed
      only limited intergenomic recombination between two viral strains compared to
      lytic infection. Following coinfection with a mutant that is unable to
      reactivate, only coreactivation with a reactivation-proficient recombinant can
      provide the opportunity for the mutant to reactivate. We speculate that each
      individual quiescent viral genome has a low and stochastic chance to reactivate
      in each cell, an assumption that can explain the limited number of genomes
      reactivating per cell. IMPORTANCE Herpesviruses are highly prevalent and cause
      significant morbidity in the human and animal populations. Most individuals who
      are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, will
      become lifelong carriers of the virus, as HSV-1 establishes latent (quiescent)
      infections in the host cells. Reactivation from the latent state leads to many of
      the viral symptoms and to the spread of the virus among individuals. While many
      triggers for reactivation were identified, how many genomes reactivate from an
      individual cell and how are these genomes selected remain understudied. Here, we 
      identify that, in most cases, only one genome per cell reactivates. Mutated HSV-1
      genomes require coinfection with another strain to allow coreactivation. Our
      findings suggest that the decision to reactivate is determined for each quiescent
      genome separately and support the notion that reactivation preferences occur at
      the single-genome level.

TI  - Controlling Herpes Simplex Virus-Induced Immunoinflammatory Lesions Using
      Metabolic Therapy: a Comparison of 2-Deoxy-d-Glucose with Metformin.
PG  - e0068822

AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the eye can result in a blinding
      immunoinflammatory lesion in the cornea called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK). 
      This lesion is orchestrated by T cells and can be reduced in magnitude by
      anti-inflammatory drugs and procedures that change the balance of cellular
      participants in lesions. This report evaluates the effect of drugs that cause
      metabolic reprogramming on lesion expression using two drugs that affect glucose 
      metabolism: 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) and metformin. Both drugs could limit HSK
      severity, but 2DG therapy could result in herpes encephalitis if used when
      replicating virus was still present. The reason metformin was a safer therapy was
      its lack of marked inhibitory effects on inflammatory cells particularly
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing Th1 and CD8 T cells in the trigeminal
      ganglion (TG), in which HSV latency is established and sustained. Additionally,
      whereas 2DG in TG cultures with established latency accelerated the termination
      of latency, this did not occur in the presence of metformin, likely because the
      inflammatory cells remained functional. Our results support the value of
      metabolic reprogramming to control viral immunoinflammatory lesions, but the
      approach used should be chosen with caution. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus
      (HSV) infection of the eye is an example where damaging lesions are in part the
      consequence of a host response to the infection. Moreover, it was shown that
      changing the representation of cellular participants in the inflammatory reaction
      can minimize lesion severity. This report explores the value of metabolic
      reprogramming using two drugs that affect glucose metabolism to achieve cellular 
      rebalancing. It showed that two drugs, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) and metformin,
      effectively diminished ocular lesion expression, but only metformin avoided the
      complication of HSV spreading to the central nervous system (CNS) and causing
      herpetic encephalitis. The report provides some mechanistic explanations for the 
      findings.

TI  - Herpes simplex virus lymphadenitis is associated with tumor reduction in a
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient.
LID - 10.1172/JCI161109 [doi]
LID - e161109 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus lymphadenitis (HSVL) is an unusual presentation 
      of HSV reactivation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients characterized 
      by systemic symptoms and no herpetic lesions. The immune responses during HSVL
      have not been studied. METHODS: Peripheral blood and lymph node samples of a
      patient with HSVL were obtained. HSV-2 viral load, antibody levels, B and T cell 
      responses, cytokine levels, and tumor burden were measured. RESULTS: This patient
      showed HSV-2 viremia for at least 6 weeks. During this period, she had a robust
      HSV-specific antibody response with neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular 
      phagocytosis activity. Activated (HLA-DR+, CD38+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased
      18-fold and HSV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in the blood at higher
      numbers. HSV-specific B and T cell responses in the lymph node were also
      detected. Markedly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood
      were also observed. Surprisingly, a sustained decrease in CLL tumor burden
      without CLL-directed therapy was observed with this and also a prior episode of
      HSVL. CONCLUSION: HSVL should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis
      in CLL patients who present with signs and symptoms of aggressive lymphoma
      transformation. An interesting finding was the sustained tumor control after 2
      episodes of HSVL in this patient. This tumor burden reduction may be due to the
      HSV-specific response serving as an adjuvant for activating tumor-specific or
      bystander T cells. Studies in additional CLL patients are needed to confirm and
      extend these findings. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health and Winship Cancer 
      Institute.

AB  - Chemical modifications of mRNA, the so-called epitranscriptome, represent an
      additional layer of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The most 
      common epitranscriptomic modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is generated by 
      a multi-subunit methyltransferase complex. We show that alphaherpesvirus kinases 
      trigger phosphorylation of several components of the m6A methyltransferase
      complex, including METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP, which correlates with inhibition of
      the complex and a near complete loss of m6A levels in mRNA of virus-infected
      cells. Expression of the viral US3 protein is necessary and sufficient for
      phosphorylation and inhibition of the m6A methyltransferase complex. Although m6A
      methyltransferase complex inactivation is not essential for virus replication in 
      cell culture, the consensus m6A methylation motif is under-represented in
      alphaherpesvirus genomes, suggesting evolutionary pressure against methylation of
      viral transcripts. Together, these findings reveal that phosphorylation can be
      associated with inactivation of the m6A methyltransferase complex, in this case
      mediated by the viral US3 protein.

LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo6406 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops predominantly in the inflammatory
      environment of a cirrhotic liver caused by hepatitis, toxin exposure, or chronic 
      liver disease. A targeted therapeutic approach is required to enable cancer
      killing without causing toxicity and liver failure. Poly(beta-amino-ester) (PBAE)
      nanoparticles (NPs) were used to deliver a completely CpG-free plasmid harboring 
      mutant herpes simplex virus type 1 sr39 thymidine kinase (sr39) DNA to human HCC 
      cells. Transfection with sr39 enables cancer cell killing with the prodrug
      ganciclovir and accumulation of 9-(4-(18)F-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine
      ((18)F-FHBG) for in vivo imaging. Targeting was achieved using a CpG-free human
      alpha fetoprotein (AFP) promoter (CpGf-AFP-sr39). Expression was restricted to
      AFP-producing HCC cells, enabling selective transfection of orthotopic HCC
      xenografts. CpGf-AFP-sr39 NP treatment resulted in 62% reduced tumor size, and
      therapeutic gene expression was detectable by positron emission tomography (PET).
      This systemic nanomedicine achieved tumor-specific delivery, therapy, and
      imaging, representing a promising platform for targeted treatment of HCC.

AB  - Cervicitis is a frequent condition caused mainly by sexually trans- mitted
      agents. The clinical spectrum varies from absence of symptoms to extensive
      inflammatory processes that may simulate a malignant neoplasm. We present a
      clinical case of an adolescent with genital ulcers and systemic disease.
      Speculoscopy revealed a tumoral-looking cervix. Laboratory studies confirm
      infection with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and Mycoplasma genitalium, together
      with a histological study that ruled out neoplasia. It progresses favorably to
      antimicrobial treatment, with recovery of the appearance of the cervix.
      Cervicitis rarely presents with necrotic involvement. Co-infection with HSV-2 and
      M. genitalium infection may have been the determinant of cervical damage and the 
      necrotic appearance. A thorough evaluation and study with highly sensitive and
      specific diagnostic tests allowed an adequate diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Synthetic antioxidants from a natural source can overtake the oncogenic stress
      management system and activate the stresssensitized death of KSHVinfected cancer 
      cells.

LID - 117 [pii]
AB  - Synthetic and modified natural derivatives are reported as potential bioactive
      compounds and are being used therapeutically against various diseases in a
      widespread manner nowadays. Cancerous cells exhibit high levels of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) internally, and thus successfully manage to sustain
      themselves and proliferate via antioxidative mechanisms that maintain a redox
      balance. On this note, various antioxidants are applied as anticancer compounds, 
      which strategically affects the ongoing oncogenic stress management system in
      both a pro and antioxidative manner, resulting in cancer restriction, as well as 
      sustaining cell proliferation via antioxidative mechanisms that promote cancer
      progression. Alike nonviral cancers, viral cancers exhibit varying levels of ROS 
      during different stages of cancer progression. Hence, successful stress balance
      should be addressed, depending on the cancer cell stress response during the
      therapeutic management. The application of antioxidants is crucial and needs to
      be carefully designed in such cases; the respective underlying mechanisms are
      less understood. The role of antioxidants controlling the varied levels of stress
      response at different stages of Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpes virus
      malignancy have not been fully reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to
      analyze the activity of certain antioxidants in KSHVinfected oncogenic cells. For
      this purpose, two naturally derived flavonoidbased antioxidants (theaflavin and
      novel curcumin derivatives) were selected and tested in different KSHVinfected
      cell lines. The findings presented herein demonstrate that these compounds can
      successfully induce the death of different KSHVpositive cells and can restrict
      the growth of KSHVinfected cell lines restricting viral reactivation by
      counteracting the oncogenic stress management system.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccination has become widespread.
      Recently, it has been suggested that instances of herpes zoster increase
      following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Herein, we describe the first case of zoster
      sine herpete (ZSH) after mRNA vaccination for COVID-19. A 60-year-old Japanese
      immunocompetent man presented with fever, fatigue, headache, cervical pain, and
      lumbar pain, which developed after receiving a second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA
      COVID-19 vaccination. Whereas most symptoms improved with symptomatic treatment, 
      headache and numbness of the right forehead persisted in areas innervated by the 
      trigeminal and second and third cervical nerves. Based on positive results of an 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examination for anti-VZV IgM, ZSH was
      diagnosed, and amitriptyline improved the patient's symptoms. Diagnosis of ZSH is
      challenging due to the lack of a characteristic herpes zoster rash. Physicians
      should be aware that ZSH can develop after mRNA vaccination.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Encephalitis in an Immunocompetent Adult: A Case
      Report on an Unusual but Relevant Cause of Significant Neurological Morbidity.
PG  - e25968
LID - 10.7759/cureus.25968 [doi]
AB  - Encephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain that is most frequently caused
      by viral infection (particularly herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1]). In some
      instances, it may be associated with substantial neurological mortality and
      long-term morbidity. Although HSV-1 is the most common agent involved in
      producing neurological infections and disorders, herpes simplex virus type 2
      (HSV-2) can occasionally affect the central nervous system, particularly in
      immunocompromised patients. We discuss the case of an immunocompetent male
      patient with a history of well-controlled diabetes who presented with symptoms of
      encephalitis. Our patient did not have a history of herpes infection, indicating 
      the presence of subclinical infections. His initial magnetic resonance imaging
      was inconclusive, but the diagnosis was established following a lumbar puncture
      and subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analyses.

TI  - Human herpesvirus DNA occurrence in intracranial aneurysmal wall: illustrative
      case.
PG  - CASE21301
LID - 10.3171/CASE21301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhages secondary to intracranial aneurysms (IAs)
      are events of high mortality. These neurological vascular diseases arise from
      local and systemic inflammation that culminates in vessel wall changes. They may 
      also have a possible relationship with chronic viral infections, such as human
      herpesvirus (HHV), and especially Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes several 
      medical conditions. This is the first description of the presence of HHV
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a patient with IA. OBSERVATIONS: A 61-year-old
      woman with a downgraded level of consciousness underwent radiological
      examinations that identified a 10-mm ruptured aneurysm in the anterior
      communicating artery. A microsurgery clip was performed to definitively treat the
      aneurysm and occurred without surgical complications. Molecular analysis of the
      material obtained revealed the presence of EBV DNA in the aneurysm wall. The
      patient died 21 days after admission due to clinical complications and brain
      swelling. LESSONS: This is the first description of the presence of herpesvirus
      DNA in a patient with IA, presented in 2.8% of our data. These findings highlight
      that viral infection may contribute to the pathophysiology and is an additional
      risk factor for IA formation, progression, and rupture by modulating vessel wall 
      inflammation and structural changes in chronic infections.

TI  - Incidences of Infectious Events in a Renal Transplant Cohort of the German Center
      of Infectious Diseases (DZIF).
PG  - ofac243
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac243 [doi]
AB  - Background: Infectious complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      after kidney transplantation. Methods: In this transplant cohort study at the
      German Center of Infectious Diseases (DZIF), we evaluated all infections
      occurring during the first year after renal transplantation. We assessed
      microbial etiology, incidence rates, and temporal occurrence of these infections.
      Results: Of 804 renal transplant recipients (65.2% male, 51 +/- 14 years), 439
      (54.6%) had 972 infections within the first year after transplantation. Almost
      half of these infections (47.8%) occurred within the first 3 months. Bacteria
      were responsible for 66.4% (645/972) of all infections, followed by viral (28.9% 
      [281/972]) and fungal (4.7% [46/972]) pathogens. The urinary tract was the most
      common site of infection (42.4%). Enterococcus was the most frequently isolated
      bacterium (20.9%), followed by E. coli (17.6%) and Klebsiella (12.5%). E. coli
      was the leading pathogen in recipients <50 years of age, whereas Enterococcus
      predominated in older recipients. Resistant bacteria were responsible for at
      least 1 infection in 9.5% (76/804) of all recipients. Viral infections occurred
      in 201 recipients (25.0%). Of these, herpes viruses predominated (140/281
      [49.8%]), and cytomegalovirus had the highest incidence rate (12.3%). In the 46
      fungal infections, Candida albicans (40.8%) was the most commonly isolated. Other
      fungal opportunistic pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus and Pneumocystis,
      were rare. Conclusions: Renal allograft recipients in Germany experience a high
      burden of infectious complications in the first year after transplantation.
      Bacteria were the predominating pathogen, followed by opportunistic infections
      such as cytomegalovirus. Microbial etiology varied between age groups, and
      resistant bacteria were identified in 10% of recipients.

TI  - A typical presentation of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome with pulmonary
      involvement: a case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 279
LID - 10.1186/s12890-022-02064-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
      syndrome is a kind of hypersensitivity drug reaction involving the skin and
      multiple internal organ systems. Moxifloxacin has rarely been reported to be a
      drug that is associated with DRESS syndrome. Lungs are less frequently involved
      in DRESS syndrome, but their involvements may herald more serious clinical
      processes. We present a rare typical case of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome 
      with lungs involved. Valuable clinical data such as changes in the pulmonary
      imaging and pulmonary function tests was recorded. This case is important for the
      differential diagnosis of DRESS syndrome with lungs involved by providing
      clinical manifestations, CT imaging, pulmonary function tests, and biopsy
      pathological characteristics. The changes in pulmonary imaging and pulmonary
      function tests may help us understand the mechanism of DRESS syndrome further.
      CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 47-year-old woman who was treated with
      oral moxifloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient subsequently
      developed a cough, fever, liver injury, skin rash, hematologic abnormalities, and
      shortness of breath (SOB) followed by pharyngeal herpes and peripheral neuritis. 
      These symptoms, clinical lab index, and CT scan of the lungs improved after the
      withdrawal of moxifloxacin. The probability of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS
      syndrome was rated as "Definite", with 7 scores graded by RegiSCAR. A literature 
      search was also performed with "fluoroquinolones," "moxifloxacin,"
      "ciprofloxacin," "levofloxacin," "delafloxacin," and "DRESS" or "drug-induced
      hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS)" as the keywords that were put into PubMed. The 
      overall pulmonary involvement was approximately 9.1% (1/11). It is a rare
      reported case of DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement induced by
      moxifloxacin. We summarized detailed clinical data, including pulmonary imaging
      and pulmonary function changes. CONCLUSION: This is a rare reported case of DRESS
      syndrome with pulmonary involvement induced by moxifloxacin. Prompt recognition
      and correct diagnosis can promote appropriate treatment and accelerate recovery. 
      This case is important for us as a reference in the differential diagnosis of
      DRESS syndrome and helps us further understand the mechanism of DRESS syndrome.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screen for HSV-1 host factors reveals PAPSS1 contributes to
      heparan sulfate synthesis.
PG  - 694
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03581-9 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes various 
      diseases in humans, ranging from common mucocutaneous lesions to severe
      life-threatening encephalitis. However, our understanding of the interaction
      between HSV-1 and human host factors remains incomplete. Here, to identify the
      host factors for HSV-1 infection, we performed a human genome-wide CRISPR screen 
      using near-haploid HAP1 cells, in which gene knockout (KO) could be efficiently
      achieved. Along with several already known host factors, we identified
      3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (PAPSS1) as a host factor for
      HSV-1 infection. The KO of PAPSS1 in HAP1 cells reduced heparan sulfate (HepS)
      expression, consequently diminishing the binding of HSV-1 and several other
      HepS-dependent viruses (such as HSV-2, hepatitis B virus, and a human seasonal
      coronavirus). Hence, our findings provide further insights into the host factor
      requirements for HSV-1 infection and HepS biosynthesis.

PG  - 12317
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15942-9 [doi]
AB  - The HSV-1 tegument protein Us11 counteracts the antiviral defense mechanisms by
      precluding the host protein shutoff. Previous works demonstrated that Us11
      prevents heat-and staurosporine-induced apoptosis and inhibits autophagy.
      Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that HSV-1,
      through Us11, could recruit caspase-8, a key enzyme regulating programmed cell
      death. We first show that HSV-1 promotes the accumulation of caspase-8-p18 active
      fragments in both semi permissive THP-1 cells and fully permissive HEp-2 cells to
      HSV-1 replication. Using a recombinant virus R3630 (DeltaUs11/DeltaUs12) and a
      plasmid encoding Us11-recombinant protein we have proven that Us11 promotes p18
      accumulation, which does not trigger the apoptotic signaling. Additional, in an
      in vitro model, we demonstrated that Us11-recombinant protein induces
      caspase-8-p18 cleavage by physically interacting with the caspase-8 recombinant
      protein. Finally, we found that, during HSV-1 replication, activated-caspase-8
      cleaves Atg3 protein to potentially block autophagy and support its replication.

AB  - Herpes zoster (HZ) is the infectious reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. 
      HZ is more frequent in immunocompromised subjects, including patients with
      cancer. HZ complications can even last for years with a consequent delay in
      treatment of the underlying malignancy and with an unfavorable impact on quality 
      of life. Nowadays, HZ is a vaccine-preventable disease: the recent approval of
      adjuvanted glycoprotein E-based recombinant zoster vaccine has changed preventive
      perspectives in immunocompromised subjects. Recombinant zoster vaccine induced
      both strong humoral and cellular immune responses also in immunocompromised
      patients. The question is, therefore, to which categories of cancer patients we
      should recommend HZ vaccination. Based on a careful review of the available data 
      present in the literature, including recommendations and expert opinions, we
      report the position of the Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica on HZ
      vaccination in adult patients with solid tumors, thus providing clinical practice
      advice in a field where clear-cut information is missing.

      diagnosed as HSV stromal keratitis or endotheliitis and treated successfully with
      topical steroids as well as systemic and topical antiviral treatment. CONCLUSION:
      HSV keratitis is not recommend when treated with periocular corticosteroid
      injection. Topical corticosteroid is the best choice for HSV stromal keratitis
      and HSV endotheliitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coxsackie Virus and Adenovirus Receptor (CXADR or CAR) is involved in
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aimed to
      examine the relationship of CAR expression on platelets and cardiomyocytes with
      virus persistence, local and systemic inflammation and platelet activity in
      patients with DCM. METHODS: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples of 38 patients
      (mean age 39.5+/-11.3 years, 20 male) with DCM were analyzed for CAR expression, 
      local inflammation grade by immunohistochemistry and virus persistence by
      real-time PCR. Platelet morphology was analyzed in all patients and 30 healthy
      subjects (HS) using scanning electron microscopy, platelet activity by light
      transmission aggregation, and CAR persistence by immunofluorescence. Platelets of
      20 patients were analyzed for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1-2 by
      immunofluorescence. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and
      Interleukin-6 were assessed using ELISA in all studied subjects. RESULTS: CAR
      expression in EMB samples was related to the heart failure functional class and
      the level of IL-6. Platelets from DCM patients showed enhanced spontaneous and
      ADP induced aggregation. Platelets' CAR expression was >4 fold higher in DCM than
      HS and was observed predominantly at sites of intercellular communications in
      microaggregates and leukocyte-platelet aggregates. CAR-positive patients showed
      significantly higher TNF-alpha and IL-6 serum levels in CAR-negative patients.
      Platelets of 6 (30%) DCM patients revealed the mature cytomegalovirus and herpes 
      simplex viruses particles. CONCLUSION: Tight junction protein CAR may serve as a 
      docking pin creating a new type of contact structure that could be responsible
      for signaling between neighboring cells in pathological conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hematopoietic stem-cell (HSCT) and solid organ transplant
      (SOT) recipients are particularly at risk to develop herpes zoster and its
      complications. A recently approved nonlive, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine
      (aRZV) is a potential candidate to provide durable prevention of herpes zoster.
      This review summarizes current scientific evidence and expert recommendations for
      its use in these populations and offers practical clinical guidance. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Recent clinical trials have shown aRZV to be well tolerated and
      efficacious in the prevention of herpes zoster, even in the elderly. Data are
      emerging that this vaccine might also be effective in immunocompromised
      individuals, such as SOT and HSCT recipients. Evidence is sparse regarding
      optimal timing of vaccination and durability of responses. However, several
      specialized societies have already established expert-based aRZV immunization
      recommendations for these vulnerable populations. SUMMARY: Practical
      considerations, safety concerns, and timing of vaccine administration vary from
      one immunocompromised subpopulation to another. Initial studies show that aRZV
      has a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile in SOT and HSCT recipients.
      However, data are sparse, particularly in allogeneic HSCT, and practical
      recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion. Additional research is needed
      to offer better insight on aRZV administration in immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Immunocompromised host section: Adoptive T-cell therapy for dsDNA viruses in
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.
PG  - 302-311
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000838 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses remain important causes of
      morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT). As treatment options are limited, adoptive therapy with virus-specific T
      cells (VST) is promising in restoring immunity and thereby preventing and
      treating virus infections. Here we review current evidence and recent advances in
      the field of VST for dsDNA viruses in allogeneic HCT recipients. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Four different protocols for VST generation are currently used in clinical
      trials, and various products including multivirus-specific and off-the-shelf
      products are under investigation for prophylaxis, preemptive therapy or
      treatment. Data from nearly 1400 dsDNA-VST applications in allogeneic HCT
      patients have been published and demonstrated its safety. Although Epstein-Barr
      virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus-specific T-cell therapy studies have
      predominated over the past 25 years, additional human herpes viruses were added
      to multivirus-specific T cells over the last decade and clinical evidence for
      polyomavirus-specific VST has just recently emerged. Response rates of around
      70-80% have been reported, but cautious interpretation is warranted as data are
      predominantly from phase 1/2 studies and clinical efficacy needs to be confirmed 
      in phase 3 studies. SUMMARY: Investigation on the 'ideal' composition of VST is
      ongoing. Several products recently entered phase 3 trials and may allow
      widespread clinical use in the near future.

      neuroinflammation during neurotropic herpesvirus infection.

AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1
      (HSV-1), is a severe central nervous system disease commonly followed by
      cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and focal neurological signs. Although 
      increasing evidence implicates the central role of microglia in HSE progression, 
      the intrinsic restrictors or the acquired environmental factors that balance the 
      beneficial or detrimental immune responses in microglia remain unclear. In a
      recent study, we find that a gut microbial metabolite activates mitophagy to
      regulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and to mitigate HSE progression.
      HSV-1 neurotropic infection causes gut microbiota dysbiosis and microglial
      antiviral immune response, whereas depletion of gut microbiota by oral
      antibiotics treatment further results in hyperactivated microglia and exacerbated
      HSE pathology. Notably, exogenous administration of nicotinamide n-oxide (NAMO), 
      an oxidative product of nicotinamide mainly produced by intestinal
      neomycin-sensitive bacteria, especially Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus
      reuteri, can significantly suppress HSE progression. Mechanistically, HSV-1
      infection causes mitochondrial dysfunction and impairs mitophagy to activate
      microglia and promote proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas NAMO restores 
      NAD+-dependent mitophagy to restrain microglial over-activation and to prevent
      HSV-1 early infection in neuronal cells. This work reveals a novel function of
      gut microbial metabolites as intrinsic regulators of microglia homeostasis and
      neuroinflammation via mitophagy.Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer disease; ABX:

TI  - Case Report: Acute Retinal Necrosis after a Cervical Epidural Steroid Injection.
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001920 [doi]
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Acute retinal necrosis is a rare, sight-threatening condition
      typically found in immunocompromised patients and is most commonly caused by
      varicella zoster virus. Due to the poor prognosis and rapid progression of the
      disease course, prompt antiviral management is paramount. PURPOSE: A case report 
      of acute retinal necrosis in a patient with herpes virus infection following a
      cervical epidural corticosteroid injection. Extensive laboratory work and
      frequent follow-ups are necessary for management. This case report outlines the
      clinical signs of acute retinal necrosis and discusses the appropriate referrals 
      and treatment needed to improve prognosis. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old man
      presented to our eye clinic with symptoms of pain and light sensitivity.
      Examination revealed anterior uveitis, vitritis, optic disc edema, macular edema,
      vasculitis, and retinitis of the left eye. The serum antibody test results showed
      abnormal ranges for varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus type 1, and
      the patient was diagnosed with acute retinal necrosis. Treatment prescribed by a 
      retina specialist included oral valacyclovir and later oral prednisolone, for
      which the patient responded well before developing the common complication of
      retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS: The progressive nature of acute retinal necrosis
      is usually debilitating to vision, even when managed properly. Because prognosis 
      is often poor, it is important to make proper diagnoses combined with a complete 
      review of the patient's medical history and immune status to prevent further
      vision loss.

TI  - Acute Unilateral Peripheral Vestibulopathy After COVID-19 Vaccination: Initial
      Experience in a Tertiary Neurotology Center.
PG  - 917845
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.917845 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to identify patients who developed
      acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy (AUPVP) after COVID-19 vaccination.
      Methods: For this single-center, retrospective study, we screened the medical
      records of our tertiary interdisciplinary neurotology center for patients who had
      presented with AUPVP within 30 days after COVID-19 vaccination (study period: 1
      June-31 December 2021). The initial diagnosis of AUPVP was based on a
      comprehensive bedside neurotological examination. Laboratory vestibular testing
      (video head impulse test, cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic
      potentials, dynamic visual acuity, subjective visual vertical, video-oculography,
      caloric testing) was performed 1-5 months later. Results: Twenty-six patients
      were diagnosed with AUPVP within the study period. Of those, n = 8 (31%) had
      developed acute vestibular symptoms within 30 days after COVID-19 vaccination
      (mean interval: 11.9 days, SD: 4.8, range: 6-20) and were thus included in the
      study. The mean age of the patients (two females, six males) was 46 years (SD:
      11.7). Seven patients had received the Moderna mRNA vaccine and one the
      Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. All patients displayed a horizontal(-torsional)
      spontaneous nystagmus toward the unaffected ear and a pathological clinical head 
      impulse test toward the affected ear on initial clinical examination.
      Receptor-specific laboratory vestibular testing performed 1-5 months later
      revealed recovery of vestibular function in two patients, and heterogeneous
      lesion patterns of vestibular endorgans in the remaining six patients. Discussion
      and Conclusions: The present study should raise clinicians' awareness for AUPVP
      after COVID-19 vaccination. The relatively high fraction of such cases among our 
      AUPVP patients may be due to a certain selection bias at a tertiary neurotology
      center. Patients presenting with acute vestibular symptoms should be questioned
      about their vaccination status and the date of the last vaccination dose.
      Furthermore, cases of AUPVP occurring shortly after a COVID-19 vaccination should
      be reported to the health authorities to help determining a possible causal
      relationship.

PG  - 3109331
LID - 10.1155/2022/3109331 [doi]
AB  - Background: In rare cases, HSV infections can present as pseudotumors that are
      often mistaken as malignancies in patients with an uncontrolled HIV infection.
      Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection rates range from 60% to 90% in
      individuals coinfected with HIV. Case Presentation. A 48-year-old patient
      presented with a large fungating mass near her right inferior vulva with a
      hardness of surrounding tissues. The mass was 4 cm x 3 cm in size and was excised
      in the operating room. The pathology was negative for malignancy; however, it
      showed lymphoplasmacytic proliferation with immunostaining positive for HSV
      virus. Conclusion: Atypical HSV pseudotumors should be considered in the
      differential diagnosis for an immunosuppressed patient who presents with a
      genital mass lesion.

      review.
PG  - 130-132
LID - 10.1177/1753495X20978037 [doi]
AB  - We present the case of a healthy nulliparous woman who presented with persistent 
      fever, proteinuria and elevated transaminases at 33 weeks' gestation. Following
      initial treatment for suspected chorioamnionitis and potential pre-eclampsia, she
      had a caesarean section delivering a healthy male infant. However, on her third
      post-operative day, she developed neurological symptoms and accompanying severe
      sepsis, necessitating inotropic support and transfer to a higher level of care. A
      comprehensive work-up revealed herpes simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) in serum and
      cerebrospinal fluid. Abdominal imaging was suggestive of accompanying hepatitis
      with micro-abscesses. This lady recovered well following intravenous acyclovir
      for 14 days. Her infant was not affected and was discharged home with his mother.
      Herpes simplex encephalitis and hepatitis associated with HSV-2 have been
      described three times previously in pregnancy. We delineate the diagnostic
      challenges that rare conditions such as this pose and emphasise the importance of
      multi-disciplinary care in managing complicated medical conditions in pregnancy.

AB  - Aim The article aims to study the prevalence and ocular manifestations of the
      various types of common skin disorders at a tertiary hospital in Ahmedabad,
      India. Materials and methods Five hundred patients were studied in the
      ophthalmology department from September 2017 to September 2019. Results Out of
      the 500 patients that were included in our study, 312 were males, and 188 were
      females. In our study, lid involvement was seen most commonly in patients with
      herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Plexiform neurofibroma was seen in eight
      (14.5%) patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). Cicatricial ectropion was found in 
      half of the patients with ichthyosis. Lagophthalmos was present in 10 (20.4%)
      patients with leprosy. Conjunctivitis was seen commonly in HZO patients.
      Papillary conjunctivitis was seen in half of the atopic dermatitis cases. Steven 
      Johnson's syndrome (SJS) was associated with pseudomembranous conjunctivitis.
      Conjunctival xerosis was seen only in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. The
      cornea was most commonly involved in patients of HZO. Decreased corneal sensation
      was seen in leprosy and HZO. Lisch nodules were seen in NF cases. Anterior
      uveitis was found in seven (6.3%) patients with HZO. Glaucoma was seen most
      commonly in patients with Sturge Weber syndrome (SWS), followed by leprosy.
      Facial nerve palsy was seen in patients with leprosy. Episcleritis was seen in
      patients with leprosy and SWS. Conclusion We conclude that ocular involvement in 
      skin disease is a common feature and could be a major component of the
      development of various systemic skin disorders.

LID - 10.1186/s43556-022-00078-z [doi]
AB  - A virus enters a living organism and recruits host metabolism to reproduce its
      own genome and proteins. The viral infections are intricate and cannot be
      completely removed through existing antiviral drugs. For example, the herpes,
      influenza, hepatitis and human immunodeficiency viruses are a few dreadful ones
      amongst them. Significant studies are needed to understand the viral entry and
      their growth in host cells to design effective antivirals. This review emphasizes
      the range of therapeutical antiviral drugs, inhibitors along with vaccines to
      fight against viral pathogens, especially for combating COVID-19. Moreover, we
      have provided the basic and in depth information about viral targets, drugs
      availability, their mechanisms of action, method of prevention of viral diseases 
      and highlighted the significances of anticoagulants, convalescent plasma for
      COVID-19 treatment, scientific details of airborne transmission, characteristics 
      of antiviral drug delivery using nanoparticles/carriers, nanoemulsions, nanogels,
      metal based nanoparticles, alike the future nanosystems through nanobubbles,
      nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanotraps, nanorobots and eventually, the therapeutic
      applications of micro- and nanoparticulates, current status for clinical
      development against COVID-19 together with environmental implications of
      antivirals, gene therapy etc., which may be useful for repurposing and designing 
      of novel antiviral drugs against various dreadful diseases, especially the
      SARS-CoV-2 and other associated variants.

      They appear to be beneficial in different disorders and pathological conditions, 
      including in a broad-spectrum of infectious diseases. Aim: To estimate in vitro
      the anti-herpes simplex activity of 11 postbiotic samples (lysates or cell-free
      supernatants - CFS) produced during the fermentation of six candidate-probiotic
      Lactobacillus strains isolated from Bulgarian fermented milk products. Materials 
      and methods: In vitro protocols for assessment of different LAB samples on the
      Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication, adsorption and virucidal effects
      were applied using MDBK cells. Results: Four of the studied LAB samples expressed
      a statistically significant inhibition of the replication of HSV-1. The highest
      selective index (79.75) was calculated for the post-metabolites of
      Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, followed by a high molecular fraction of
      cell-derived fragments of Limosilactobacillus fermentum culture (S6) (SI =
      34.63), CFS from late exponential L. plantarum (SI = 28.26) and neutralized CFS
      from L. fermentum (SI = 28.11). Pronounced virucidal activities of the
      postbiotics S1, S11 (L. fermentum), S3 (L. plantarum) and S6 (L. fermentum) were 
      recorded, too. The inhibitory effect of the majority of the samples on the stage 
      of adsorption of the virus to MDBK cells was remarkable. In addition, almost all 
      of the postbiotics exerted a protective effect on healthy cells and significantly
      reduced viral yield at subsequent infection. Conclusion: Pre-selected
      Lactobacillus strains demonstrated strain-specific effects against HSV-1. These
      postbiotics influence different stages of viral infection in cell cultures and
      their promising characteristics are currently evaluated.

PG  - 3980-3987
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster (HZ) has been found to be associated with arisk of
      developing dementia. However, changes of cellular metabolism in the hippocampus
      in HZ have received little attention. This study aimed to investigate the
      cellular metabolism changes in bilateral hippocampi in acute HZ. METHODS:
      (1)H-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) was used to detect the cellular
      metabolism of bilateral hippocampi in 62 patients with acute HZ and 12 volunteers
      (control group) from July 2020 to December 2021. Mini-Mental State Examination
      (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) were used to evaluate their cognitive function,
      depression, anxiety and pain intensity, as well as a the correlation between
      them. RESULTS: The MMSE score in patients with HZ was not significantly different
      from that of controls (P>0.05), while the scores of HAMD and HAMA were
      significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of controls. Also 12.9% and 21.0% of the
      patients with acute HZ had depression and anxiety disorders, respectively. The
      level of Cho/Cr in the left/right hippocampi of HZ patients was significantly
      lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The level of Cho/Cr in the right
      hippocampus, duration of disease and NRS score in HZ patients with
      anxiety/depression were significantly higher than those without
      anxiety/depression, but the level of NAA/Cr in the right hippocampus was lower
      (P<0.05). The NRS score and duration of disease in HZ patients were positively
      correlated with the scores of HAMD and HAMA. CONCLUSION: The cellular metabolism 
      of bilateral hippocampi in patients with acute HZ is altered. Those with longer
      duration of disease and severe pain are more likely to have depression and
      anxiety disorder, and the changes in cellular metabolism of hippocampi in those
      with depression and anxiety were more prominent.

      of patients with herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.
PG  - 4350-4362
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between white matter structural changes
      and PHN by analyzing the diffusion tensor imaging data of patients with herpes
      zoster (HZ) or postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and the volunteered healthy controls
      (HC). METHODS: A total of 48 participants with HZ, 40 participants with PHN, and 
      28 age and sex matched HC were enrolled in this study. The diffusion tensor
      imaging data were collected by a Siemens 3.0T magnetic resonance scanner, and FSL
      (FMRIB's software) was used to analyze the differences in diffusion indexes among
      the HZ, PHN and HC groups. In addition, the correlation between the image and the
      clinical parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: The results indicated that the
      microstructural integrity of the white matter, which affects the information
      exchange and integration between pain and non-pain related brain regions, showed 
      difference in patients with HZ and PHN. CONCLUSION: The study may provide an
      experimental basis for more thorough longitudinal research in the future to
      explore the changes of brain structure in patients with PHN from HZ and develop
      adequate treatment strategy.

LID - 10.2147/HIV.S353166 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) is the main etiological agent of
      Kaposi's sarcoma. This virus is frequently associated with immunocompromision.
      This study aimed to detect HHV-8 in people with compromised immune system.
      Patients and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that included 180 subjects:
      179 HIV-infected patients and 1 patient with bullous pemphigoid. Blood samples
      were taken from all subjects, and swabs of lesions were then taken from
      individuals with symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. Viral load and CD4(+) T
      lymphocytes count were performed for persons living with HIV and real-time PCR
      detection of HHV-8 DNA was performed in all subjects in the study. Results: Among
      HIV-infected persons, 13.41% had a viral load of more than 10,000 copies/mL, and 
      22.91% had a CD4(+) T lymphocytes count of fewer than 350 cells/microL. A total
      of four (three HIV-1 infected patients and one patient with bullous pemphigoid)
      patients (2.22%) had apparent lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. In the plasmas and
      swabs from associated lesions, HHV-8 DNA was found in only two individuals, with 
      an HHV-8 prevalence of 1.11% (2/180) with 0.55% (1/179) in an HIV-infected
      patient on antiretroviral therapy. Conclusion: These results exposing low
      prevalence levels of HHV-8 in HIV-infected patients could be due to the
      beneficial effect of antiretroviral drugs.

AB  - We retrospectively studied the diagnosis and treatment of a case of AAD
      misdiagnosed as stroke since atypical symptoms as the first manifestation, and
      discussed the clinical features and manifestations, diagnosis, and differential
      diagnosis of the case in the context of relevant domestic and international
      literature. The patient, a 49year-old male with herpes zoster for more than 1
      month, presented with sudden onset of right-sided chest and back pain,
      accompanied by numbness and weakness of the left limb, and was tentatively
      diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia combined with stroke due to the history of
      herpes zoster. Non-specific ST-T alterations, D-dimer 20ug / ml, and
      non-traumatic angiographic findings in the transthoracic and abdominal aorta
      demonstrated slight thickening of the patient's ascending aorta, and the lumen of
      the root sinus region showed intimal flap formation with a larger pseudocoel and 
      smaller true lumen, which ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of acute aortic
      coarctation with atypical presentation. So clinicians need to improve their basic
      theoretical knowledge, strengthen the understanding of AAD, focus on physical
      examination, improve relevant auxiliary examinations expeditiously, and pay
      attention to the significance of specific auxiliary examinations in order to
      decrease misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of atypical manifestations of AAD
      patients.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoprotein D Antibodies Fail to Elicit Antibody-Dependent 
      Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity: Implications for Future Vaccines.
LID - jiac284 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gD/AS04 vaccine failed to prevent HSV-2 in clinical trials.
      Failure was recapitulated in mice where the vaccine elicited neutralizing but not
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses. Preclinical
      findings suggest that ADCC is important for protection but there is limited
      clinical data. We hypothesized that gD/AS04 and acute HSV-2 infection elicit
      primarily neutralizing antibodies whereas ADCC emerges over time. METHODS:
      HSV-specific IgG, subclass, function (neutralization, C1q binding and ADCC), and 
      antigenic targets were compared (paired t-test or Mann-Whitney) at enrollment and
      following gD/AS04 vaccination, before and after HSV-2 acquisition in vaccine
      controls, and in an independent cohort of chronic HSV-2 infection. RESULTS:
      Vaccination elicited only a neutralizing response whereas acute infection
      elicited neutralizing and C1q-binding antibodies but not a significant ADCC
      response. Antibodies to gD were exclusively IgG1 and only neutralizing. In
      contrast, women with chronic HSV-2 infection had significantly greater ADCC
      responses and targeted a broader range of viral antigens compared to
      acutely-infected or gD/AS04 vaccine recipients (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results
      from gD/AS04 vaccinated or acutely infected women recapitulate murine findings of
      limited functional antibody responses, supporting the speculation that vaccines
      that generate polyfunctional and specifically ADCC responses may be required to
      prevent HSV-2 acquisition and limit recurrences.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the presentation, clinical course and functional
      outcomes of patients with varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation involving the
      vagus nerve. To highlight the role of otolaryngology in acute and long-term
      management of laryngopharyngeal VZV and its sequelae. METHODS: Retrospective
      review of 3 patients with laryngopharyngeal VZV, managed at a tertiary referral
      center. RESULTS: All cases presented with vesicular lesions involving mucosa of
      the laryngopharynx. Each experienced vocal fold hypomobility, among other
      otolaryngologic sequelae. All were treated with systemic antivirals and
      corticosteroids. Mucosal lesions resolved within 7 days of treatment initiation; 
      functional deficits persisted for months to years. Dysphonia improved to a
      plateau at 3 months, while dysphagia took longer to resolve. One patient with
      disseminated disease experienced bilateral vocal fold paralysis requiring
      temporary tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Vagal neuropathy secondary to VZV
      reactivation is a rare clinical entity with a variety of laryngeal
      manifestations. Early initiation of systemic therapy and serial endoscopic
      evaluations are critical components of acute management when laryngopharyngeal
      involvement is suspected. Otolaryngologists should plan for long-term phonatory
      and deglutitive therapy in these cases, as neurologic sequelae can persist for
      months to years following initial insult. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4
      (Case-series).

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of JAK Inhibitors in Autoinflammatory Diseases: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 930071
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.930071 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are rare diseases presenting with
      episodes of sterile inflammation. These involve multiple organs and can cause
      both acute organ damage and serious long-term effects, like amyloidosis.
      Disease-specific anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies are established for
      some AID. However, their clinical course frequently includes relapsing,
      uncontrolled conditions. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Janus 
      Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) block key cytokines of AID pathogenesis and can be a
      potential option. Methods: A systematic review of the literature in accordance
      with the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase and
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for publications
      regarding the use of JAKi for AID. Data from the included publications was
      extracted and a narrative synthesis was performed. Criteria for defining
      treatment response were defined and applied. Results: We report data from 38
      publications with a total of 101 patients describing the effects of JAKi in AID. 
      Data on Type I Interferonopathies, Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD), Systemic
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and
      Behcet's Syndrome (BS) was identified. From a total of 52 patients with type I
      interferonopathies, in seven patients (7/52, 13.5%) a complete response was
      achieved, most (35/52, 67.3%) showed a partial response and a minority (10/52,
      19.2%) showed no treatment response. For AOSD, a complete or a partial response
      was achieved by eleven (11/26, 42.3%) patients each. Two sJIA patients achieved
      complete response (2/4, 50%) and in two cases (2/4, 50%) a partial response was
      reported. Half of FMF patients showed a complete response and the other half had 
      a partial one (3/6, 50.0%). Amongst BS patients most achieved a partial response 
      (8/13, 61.5%). Five patients showed no response to therapy (5/13, 38.5%).
      Overall, the most frequent AEs were upper respiratory tract infections (17),
      pneumonia (10), BK virus viremia (10) and viruria (4), herpes zoster infection
      (5), viral gastroenteritis (2) and other infections (4). Conclusion: The results 
      from this systematic review show that JAKi can be beneficial in certain AID. The 
      risk of AEs, especially viral infections, should be considered. To accurately
      assess the risk benefit ratio of JAKi for AID, clinical trials should be
      conducted.

AB  - Recurrent erythema multiforme (REM) may have frequent episodes over a period of
      several years and is considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction associated with
      infection or medication. REM is a mucocutaneous disorder which is characterized
      by targetoid lesions. Most of the cases are caused by herpes simplex virus
      infection. Systemic corticosteroid is frequently used to treat REM due to its
      effects in suppressing the disease. When REM is unresponsive to systemic
      corticosteroid, steroid-sparing treatment needs to be instituted. We reported a
      case of REM in a 49-year-old male. There were complaints of burning sensations on
      the skin lesions, along with swelling on both hands. On physical examination,
      erythematous macules and targetoid lesions were found on both palms, arms, and
      legs. During hospitalization, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered in a tapering 
      dose but new skin lesions still appeared. Two days after azathioprine 50 mg twice
      daily was added to the treatment, skin lesions and swelling on the patient's
      hands were diminished and the burning sensation disappeared. No side effects of
      azathioprine were found in this patient and no recurrence until two weeks after
      hospitalization. This case report demonstrated the efficacy of combined treatment
      of dexamethasone and azathioprine for REM cases unresponsive to systemic
      corticosteroid.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Electroacupuncture for Pain Control in Herpes Zoster: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 4478444
LID - 10.1155/2022/4478444 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the latent
      varicella-zoster virus, which leads to acute pain that may disturb routine
      activities and affect patients' quality of life. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been
      commonly used for treating herpetic pain in clinical treatment. However, no
      relevant studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA
      for acute control in herpetic neuralgia patients. The purpose of the current
      study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the
      deficiencies of the current research. Methods: Three English (PubMed, Cochrane
      Library, and Web of Science) and four Chinese (China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), Wan-fang
      database, and the Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (VIP)) were
      comprehensively searched from inception to 31 December 2021. Two independent
      reviewers evaluated the retrieved data based on the eligibility criteria in
      advance. In addition, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the
      methodological quality of the included studies. Outcome indexes in this study
      included the visual analog scale, the time to cessation of pustules, the time to 
      scabs, the time to rash healing, adverse reactions, and the incidence of
      postherpetic neuralgia. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also performed to 
      evaluate the intervention effect specifically. In addition, publication bias was 
      analyzed. Results: Six randomized controlled trials (167 participants in the
      experimental groups and 174 participants in the control groups) were identified
      as reporting the application of EA for acute herpes zoster pain and were included
      in this study. The results from our meta-analysis revealed that EA was superior
      to control treatment according to visual analog scale, the time of rash healing, 
      and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. However, in terms of the time to
      cessation of pustules, scabs, and adverse reactions, the results showed that EA
      compared with the control group showed no significant difference. In addition,
      subgroup analyses indicated that 2/100 Hz-EA has more significant effects on
      herpetic pain. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the results of EA for acute
      pain control and the rash healing time in herpetic neuralgia patients were
      stable. However, a publication bias was observed. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis
      results showed that EA could offer certain advantages in treating acute pain in
      herpetic neuralgia patients. However, small sample sizes, heterogeneity in study 
      design, and variable methodological quality weaken these inferences. In addition,
      weak evidence was found for the safety of EA.

      non-human immunodeficiency virus patient. A 79-year-old female visited the
      outpatient clinic presenting with increasing number and size of palpable masses
      on both upper and lower extremities. She was first diagnosed as drug-erupted
      dermatitis and stopped her medications, but the symptoms got worse. We did
      partial biopsy, and KS with HHV-8 was diagnosed histopathologically. She planned 
      to undergo further evaluations and proper treatments. This rare case suggests the
      need to consider a classic type of KS in the differential diagnosis of specific
      dermatologic symptoms such as macular, nodular, and darkish patches of upper or
      lower extremities in elderly patients. It is believed that this case helps to
      strengthen awareness of this rare disease.

TI  - Successful Treatment of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus Complicated by Intense Orbital
      Inflammation Using Laser Irradiation over the Stellate Ganglion.
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.9503-22 [doi]
AB  - A 56-year-old man presented with right-sided headache and ptosis accompanied by a
      facial skin rash. He was diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Despite
      acyclovir and steroid therapy, the ocular symptoms worsened. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) revealed severe orbital inflammation and abnormal lesions in the
      right trigeminal nucleus and tract. The effects of re-administration of
      intravenous acyclovir and steroid pulse therapy were limited. Laser irradiation
      of the stellate ganglion (SGL) and high-dose oral prednisolone therapy were
      effective. Our experience suggests the efficacy of early multimodal treatment,
      including SGL, in treating ocular symptoms associated with HZO.

TI  - Erythema multiforme in children.
PG  - 507-508
LID - 10.46747/cfp.6807507 [doi]
AB  - QUESTION: Children who present with rashes with "target" lesions are frequently
      diagnosed with erythema multiforme (EM). This is a self-limiting condition in
      most children; how should primary care providers differentiate between this and
      urticaria or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and what is the recommended course of
      treatment? ANSWER: While EM is common in children, urticaria is also very common 
      and tends to be more "waxing and waning" compared with EM's fixed lesions.
      Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are more severe and
      distinct conditions; they have much more substantial mucous membrane involvement 
      and contain widespread erythematous or purpuric macules with blisters. Since EM
      is a self-limiting condition, treatment of EM in children is generally
      supportive, and rarely do children need hospital admission for rehydration. In
      more severe cases involving mucous membranes or substantial pain, some patients
      will benefit from topical steroids or antihistamines. When children present with 
      signs of herpes infection, antiviral treatment (acyclovir) may be of benefit.
      Systemic steroids should be reserved for the most challenging cases.

TI  - Etiology and Risk Factors for Admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in
      Children With Encephalitis in a Developing Country.
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000003637 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a cohort of pediatric patients with encephalitis and their
      risk factors for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). STUDY
      DESIGN: Children (<18 years old), with encephalitis evaluated by conventional
      microbiology and syndromic, multiplex test in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between
      July 2017 and July 2020, were recruited from 14 hospitals that comprise the
      Colombian Network of Encephalitis in Pediatrics. Multivariate analyses were used 
      to evaluate risk factors associated with the need for PICU admission. RESULTS:
      Two hundred two children were included, of which 134 (66.3%) were male. The
      median age was 23 months (IQR 5.7-73.2). The main etiologies were bacteria (n =
      55, 27%), unspecified viral encephalitis (n = 44, 22%) and enteroviruses (n = 27,
      13%), with variations according to age group. Seventy-eight patients (38.6%)
      required management in the PICU. In multivariate analysis, factors associated
      with admission to the PICU were the presence of generalized seizures (OR 2.73;
      95% CI: 1.82-4.11), status epilepticus (OR 3.28; 95% CI: 2.32-4.62) and low
      leukocyte counts in the CSF (OR 2.86; 95% CI: 1.47-5.57). Compared with
      enterovirus, bacterial etiology (OR 7.50; 95% CI: 1.0-56.72), herpes simplex
      encephalitis (OR 11.81; 95% CI: 1.44-96.64), autoimmune encephalitis (OR 22.55;
      95% CI: 3.68-138.16) and other viral infections (OR 5.83; 95% CI: 1.09-31.20)
      increased the risk of PICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this national
      collaborative network of pediatric patients with encephalitis allow early
      identification of children at risk of needing advanced care and can guide the
      risk stratification of admission to the PICU.

TI  - Relationship of herpesvirus (HSV1, EBV, CMV, HHV6) seropositivity with depressive
      disorder and its clinical aspects: The first study in children.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27995 [doi]
AB  - Infections can lead to the onset of mood disorders in adults, partly through
      inflammatory mechanisms. However pediatric data are lacking. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the relationship between depressive disorder and
      seropositivity of herpes virus infections in children. The sample group consisted
      of patients diagnosed with depressive disorder according to DSM-5 diagnostic
      criteria and healthy volunteers, being between 11 and 18 years with clinically
      normal mental capacity. All children completed DSM-5-Level-2 Depression Scale,
      DSM-5-Level-2 Irritability Scale, DSM-5-Level-2 Sleep Scale, DSM-5-Level-2
      Somatic Symptoms Scale. The levels of anti-HSV1-IgG, anti-CMV-IgG, anti-EBNA, and
      anti-HHV6-IgG were examined in all participants. Patients with an antibody value 
      above the cut-off values specified in the test kits were evaluated as
      seropositive. The mean age was 15.54 +/- 1.57 years in the depression group (DG),
      14.87 +/- 1.76 years in the healthy control group (CG). There were 4 boys
      (11.2%), 32 girls (88.8%) in the DG, 9 boys (21.9%) and 32 girls (78.04%) in the 
      CG. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms
      of the presence of seropositivity of HSV1, CMV, EBV, and HHV6. HHV6 antibody
      levels were significantly higher in the DG (p = 0.000). A significant positive
      correlation was found between HHV6 antibodies and DSM-5 level-2 somatic symptoms 
      scale score. HHV6 antibody levels were found to be significantly higher in
      patients with existing suicidal ideation in the DG (n = 13) compared to those
      without existing suicidal ideation in the DG (p = 0.043). HHV6 persistent
      infections may be responsible for somatic symptoms and etiology of suicidal
      ideation in childhood depressive disorder.

TI  - Herpes simplex virus 1 infection on grey matter and general intelligence in
      severe mental illness.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1038/s41398-022-02044-3 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses (SMI) linked to
      both genetic and environmental factors. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is a common
      neurotropic pathogen which after the primary infection establishes latency with
      periodic reactivations. We hypothesized that the latent HSV1 infection is
      associated with brain structural abnormalities and cognitive impairment,
      especially in SMI. We included 420 adult patients with SMI (schizophrenia or
      bipolar spectrum) and 481 healthy controls. Circulating HSV1 immunoglobulin G
      concentrations were measured with immunoassays. We measured the total grey matter
      volume (TGMV), cortical, subcortical, cerebellar and regional cortical volumes
      based on T1-weighted MRI scans processed in FreeSurfer v6.0.0. Intelligence
      quotient (IQ) was assessed with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.
      Seropositive patients had significantly smaller TGMV than seronegative patients
      (642 cm(3) and 654 cm(3), respectively; p = 0.019) and lower IQ (104 and 107,
      respectively; p = 0.018). No TGMV or IQ differences were found between
      seropositive and seronegative healthy controls. Post-hoc analysis showed that (a)
      in both schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum, seropositive patients had similarly
      smaller TGMV than seronegative patients, whereas the HSV1-IQ association was
      driven by the schizophrenia spectrum group, and (b) among all patients,
      seropositivity was associated with smaller total cortical (p = 0.016), but not
      subcortical or cerebellar grey matter volumes, and with smaller left caudal
      middle frontal, precentral, lingual, middle temporal and banks of superior
      temporal sulcus regional cortical grey matter volumes. The results of this
      cross-sectional study indicate that HSV1 may be an environmental factor
      associated with brain structural abnormalities and cognitive impairment in SMI.

TI  - LIGHT (TNFSF14) Costimulation Enhances Myeloid Cell Activation and Antitumor
      Immunity in the Setting of PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT Checkpoint Blockade.
PG  - 510-525
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2101175 [doi]
AB  - Coinhibition of TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) and
      PD-1/PD-L1 (PD-1/L1) may improve response rates compared with monotherapy PD-1/L1
      blockade in checkpoint naive non-small cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression
      >50%. TIGIT mAbs with an effector-competent Fc can induce myeloid cell
      activation, and some have demonstrated effector T cell depletion, which carries a
      clinical liability of unknown significance. TIGIT Ab blockade translates to
      antitumor activity by enabling PVR signaling through CD226 (DNAM-1), which can be
      directly inhibited by PD-1. Furthermore, DNAM-1 is downregulated on
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in advanced and checkpoint
      inhibition-resistant cancers. Therefore, broadening clinical responses from TIGIT
      blockade into PD-L1(low) or checkpoint inhibition-resistant tumors, may be
      induced by immune costimulation that operates independently from PD-1/L1
      inhibition. TNFSF14 (LIGHT) was identified through genomic screens, in vitro
      functional analysis, and immune profiling of TILs as a TNF ligand that could
      provide broad immune activation. Accordingly, murine and human bifunctional
      fusion proteins were engineered linking the extracellular domain of TIGIT to the 
      extracellular domain of LIGHT, yielding TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT. TIGIT competitively
      inhibited binding to all PVR ligands. LIGHT directly activated myeloid cells
      through interactions with LTbetaR (lymphotoxin beta receptor), without the
      requirement for a competent Fc domain to engage Fcgamma receptors. LIGHT
      costimulated CD8(+) T and NK cells through HVEM (herpes virus entry mediator A). 
      Importantly, HVEM was more widely expressed than DNAM-1 on T memory stem cells
      and TILs across a range of tumor types. Taken together, the mechanisms of
      TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT promoted strong antitumor activity in preclinical tumor models of 
      primary and acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade, suggesting that immune
      costimulation mediated by LIGHT may broaden the clinical utility of TIGIT
      blockade.

AB  - Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare neurobehavioral disorder caused by a bilateral
      temporal lobe lesion affecting the hippocampus and amygdala; clinically
      characterised by hyperorality, hypermetamorphosis, placidity, altered sexual
      behaviour, eating, disorders and visual impairment, agnosia and amnesia. However,
      the complete syndrome is rarely seen, and diagnosis does not require all the
      symptoms to be manifested simultaneously.We describe a patient who developed a
      complete Kluver-Bucy syndrome secondary to bilateral temporal involvement due to 
      herpetic encephalitis.

AB  - Viral diseases are prominent among the widely spread infections threatening human
      well-being. Real-life clinical successes of the few available therapeutics are
      challenged by pathogenic resistance and suboptimal delivery to target sites.
      Nanotechnology has aided the design of functionalised and non-functionalised Au
      and Ag nanobiomaterials through physical, chemical and biological (green
      synthesis) methods with improved antiviral efficacy and delivery. In this review,
      innovative designs as well as interesting antiviral activities of the
      nanotechnology-inclined biomaterials of Au and Ag, reported in the last 5 years
      were critically overviewed against several viral diseases affecting man. These
      include influenza, respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory
      syndromes (SARS), rotavirus, norovirus, measles, chikungunya, HIV, herpes simplex
      virus, dengue, polio, enterovirus and rift valley fever virus. Notably identified
      among the nanotechnologically designed promising antiviral agents include
      AuNP-M2e peptide vaccine, AgNP of cinnamon bark extract and AgNP of oseltamivir
      for influenza, PVP coated AgNP for RSV, PVP-AgNPs for SARS-CoV-2, AuNRs of a
      peptide pregnancy-induce d hypertension and AuNP nanocarriers of antigen for
      MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV respectively. Others are AgNPs of collagen and Bacillus
      subtilis for rotavirus, AgNPs labelled Ag30-SiO 2 for murine norovirus in water, 
      AuNPs of Allium sativum and AgNPs of ribavirin for measles, AgNPs of Citrus
      limetta and Andrographis Paniculata for Chikungunya, AuNPs of efavirenz and
      stavudine, and AgNPs-curcumin for HIV, NPAuG3-S8 for HSV, AgNPs of Moringa
      oleifera and Bruguiera cylindrica for dengue while AgNPs of polyethyleneimine and
      siRNA analogues displayed potency against enterovirus. The highlighted candidates
      are recommended for further translational studies towards antiviral therapeutic
      designs.

AB  - Optimal criteria for diagnosing and monitoring response to treatment for
      infectious and inflammatory medium-large vessel intracranial vasculitis
      presenting with stroke are lacking. We integrated intracranial vessel wall MRI
      with arterial spin labelling into our routine clinical stroke pathway to detect
      presumed inflammatory intracranial arterial vasculopathy, and monitor disease
      activity, in patients with clinical stroke syndromes. We used predefined
      standardized radiological criteria to define vessel wall enhancement, and all
      imaging findings were rated blinded to clinical details. Between 2017 and 2018,
      stroke or transient ischaemic attack patients were first screened in our vascular
      radiology meeting and followed up in a dedicated specialist stroke clinic if a
      diagnosis of medium-large inflammatory intracranial arterial vasculopathy was
      radiologically confirmed. Treatment was determined and monitored by a
      multi-disciplinary team. In this case series, 11 patients were managed in this
      period from the cohort of young stroke presenters (<55 years). The median age was
      36 years (interquartile range: 33,50), of which 8 of 11 (73%) were female. Two of
      11 (18%) had herpes virus infection confirmed by viral nucleic acid in the
      cerebrospinal fluid. We showed improvement in cerebral perfusion at 1 year using 
      an arterial spin labelling sequence in patients taking immunosuppressive therapy 
      for >4 weeks compared with those not receiving therapy [6 (100%) versus 2 (40%) P
      = 0.026]. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of vessel wall magnetic 
      resonance with arterial spin labelling imaging in detecting and monitoring
      medium-large inflammatory intracranial arterial vasculopathy activity for
      patients presenting with stroke symptoms, limiting the need to progress to brain 
      biopsy. Further systematic studies in unselected populations of stroke patients
      are needed to confirm our findings and establish the prevalence of medium-large
      artery wall inflammation.

AB  - Objectives: Acyclovir is approved to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1,
      type 2 and varicella-zoster virus. It is mainly eliminated via the kidneys, for
      which drug crystals accumulation might lead to nephrotoxicity. This study aimed
      to determine the incidence, risk factors, preventive measures, and clinical
      outcomes of acyclovir induced-nephrotoxicity. Methods: This is a retrospective
      cohort study of patients >12 years of age at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital
      (SQUH) receiving IV acyclovir therapy between January 2016 and December 2020.
      Results: Out of 191 included patients, 40 (20.1%) developed acyclovir
      induced-nephrotoxicity. Age (per year older: OR 1.04, 95 %CI 1.01-1.07), total
      duration of treatment (per day OR1.19, 95 %CI 1.06-1.33), and concomitant use of 
      vancomycin (OR 5.96, 95 %CI 1.87-19.01) were significant independent risk factors
      for acyclovir induced-nephrotoxicity development. Nine patients (4.5%) died
      during the same hospitalization, including those three patients who required
      renal replacement therapy (1.5%). Conclusion: Frequent monitoring of kidney
      function for older patients with concurrent use of vancomycin and IV hydration is
      essential to prevent IV acyclovir induced-nephrotoxicity. Antimicrobial
      stewardship is a crucial method to reduce the duration of treatment with IV
      acyclovir as appropriate.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum L. has a long history in
      many countries of being used as a herbal medicine. It is also widely used in
      Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of infections. Hypericin, a main
      component extracted from Hypericum perforatum L., has attracted the attention of 
      many researchers for its remarkable antiviral, antitumor and antidepressant
      effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: To find plant molecules that inhibit the alkaline
      nuclease (AN) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and suppress viral
      replication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioinformatics methods were used to determine
      which compounds from a variety of natural compounds in our laboratory interact
      with AN. By this means we predicted that hypericin may interact with AN and
      suppress HSV-1 replication. Experiments were then carried out to verify whether
      hypericin inhibits the bioactivity of AN. The Pichia pastoris expression system
      was used to obtain recombinant AN. The exonuclease and endonuclease activity of
      AN treated with hypericin were tested by electrophoresis. Immunohistochemical
      staining of the HSV-1 nucleocapsids was used to find out whether hypericin
      inhibits the intracellular function of AN. Real-time PCR and western blotting
      analysis were performed to test viral gene expression and viral protein
      synthesis. The extent of viral replication inhibited by hypericin was determined 
      by a plaque assay and a time of addition assay. RESULTS: Recombinant AN was
      obtained by Pichia pastoris expression system. The exonuclease and endonuclease
      activity of recombinant AN were inhibited by hypericin in the electrophoresis
      assay. Hypericin showed no inhibitory effect on BeyoZonase Super Nuclease or
      DNase I. T5 Exonuclease activity was inhibited partially by10 muM hypericin, and 
      was completely suppressed by 50 muM hypericin. Hind was inhibited by hypericin at
      concentrations greater than 100 muM, but EcoR I, BamH I, and Sal I were not
      inhibited by hypericin. HSV-1 nucleocapsids gathered in the nucleus when the
      viruses were treated with hypericin. Plaque formation was significantly reduced
      by hypericin (EC50 against HSV-1 F is 2.59 +/- 0.08 muM and EC50 against HSV-1
      SM44 is 2.94 +/- 0.10 muM). UL12, ICP27, ICP8, gD, and UL53 gene expression (P < 
      0.01, 4.0 muM hypericin treated group vs control group) and ICP4 (P < 0.05, 6.0
      muM hypericin treated group vs control group), ICP8 and gD (P < 0.05, 2.0 muM
      hypericin treated group vs control group) protein synthesis were inhibited by
      hypericin. In the time of addition assay, HSV-1 was suppressed by hypericin in
      the early stages of viral replication. Hypericin exhibits potent virucidal
      activity against HSV-1 and inhibits the adsorption and penetration of HSV-1.
      CONCLUSION: Hypericin inhibits the bioactivity of AN and suppresses HSV-1
      replication. The data revealed a novel mechanism of the antiherpetic effect of
      hypericin.

TI  - Genotyping and evaluation of interleukin-10 and soluble HLA-G in abortion due to 
      toxoplasmosis and HSV-2 infections.

AB  - Abortion is a condition that occurs due to one of the pathological injuries,
      often one of the members of the TORCH is the real cause. The current study aimed 
      to investigate the impact of toxoplasmosis, HSV-2 infections with abortion, and
      also, the identification of immunogenetics marker (interleukin-10) that may be
      associated with abortion. Anti-Toxoplasma IgG, IgM, Herpes simplex virus-2 IgM,
      human soluble leukocyte antigen class I-G and interleukin-10 were estimated by
      ELISA technique, while the expression of IL-10 gene was investigated by using the
      real-time PCR. The results showed that among aborted women the rate of
      anti-Toxoplasma and HSV-2 IgM antibodies occurred within the age groups (21-30)
      years and (31-40) years 32(100.0%) and 36(100.0% ), respectively. A significant
      relationship was found between IL-10 and cases with a P=0.005. The pattern of
      distribution of HLA-G in the studied groups showed that there was a significant
      relationship between HLA-G and cases with a P=0.005. Regarding the IL-10 rs gene,
      the results revealed an amplified product of 377 bp and there was a high Ct value
      for patients and controls with a high Ct value of templates, preoperational to
      the gene concentration. We concluded that there was a significant relationship
      between human leukocyte antigen-G and the cases. It was found that there was a
      high Ct value for patients and controls with a high Ct value for templates.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine risk factors associated with cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
      following herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study
      METHODS: : Review of medical records of all subjects with HZO seen at the
      department of Ophthalmology, Auckland District Health Board, New Zealand, between
      1(st) January 2006 and 31(st) December 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Cerebrovascular accident within 12 months of diagnosis. RESULTS: 869 patients
      diagnosed with HZO were included in the study. The median age at onset of HZO was
      65.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 52.9 - 75.4) and 52.5% (n=456) were male.
      Antiviral therapy was started in 765 participants (88.0%), not utilised in 95
      (10.9%) and not documented in 9 participants (1.0%). Four hundred sixty-eight
      participants (54.9%) received prompt oral antiviral therapy (</=72 hours of rash 
      onset). A CVA occurred in the 12 months following HZO in 14 subjects (1.6%) and
      was most common in older subjects, occurring in 2.5% aged >/=65 years, 0.7% aged 
      40-65 years and 0.9% aged <40 years. Hazard of CVA was highest immediately
      following HZO, with median time to CVA of 2.3 months (IQR 0.8 - 5.9 months).
      Subjects that received prompt acyclovir had a 76.2% lower hazard of CVA (0.9% vs 
      2.6%, p=0.022) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular accident
      occurs in a low proportion of individuals within one year following HZO.
      Antiviral treatment for HZO may reduce the risk of subsequent CVA when given
      within 72 hours of rash onset.

TI  - Bulgarian Medicinal Extracts as Natural Inhibitors with Antiviral and
      Antibacterial Activity.
LID - 1666 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11131666 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bulgaria is a country with a wide range of medicinal plants, with
      uses in traditional medicine dating back for centuries. METHODS: Disc diffusion
      assay was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts. A
      cytopathic effect inhibition test was used for the assessment of the antiviral
      activity of the extracts. The virucidal activity of the extracts, their influence
      on the stage of viral adsorption, and their protective effect on uninfected cells
      were reported using the end-point dilution method, and Deltalgs was determined as
      compared to the untreated controls. RESULTS: The results of the study reveal that
      the antibacterial potential of G. glabra and H. perforatum extracts in
      Gram-positive bacteria is more effective than in Gram-negative bacteria. When
      applied during the replication of HSV-1 and HCov-OC-43, only some of the extracts
      showed weak activity, with SI between 2 to 8.5. Almost all tested extracts
      inhibited the extracellular virions of the studied enveloped viruses (HSV-1 and
      HCov-OC-43) to a greater extent than of the non-enveloped viruses (PV-1 and
      HAdV-5). They inhibited the stage of viral adsorption (HSV-1) in the host cell
      (MDBK) to varying degrees and showed a protective effect on healthy cells (MDBK) 
      before they were subjected to viral invasion (HSV-1). CONCLUSION: The
      antipathogenic potential of extracts of H. perforatum and G. glabra suggests
      their effectiveness as antimicrobial agents. All 13 extracts of the Bulgarian
      medicinal plants studied can be used to reduce viral yield in a wide range of
      viral infections.

TI  - Microbial Natural Products with Antiviral Activities, Including Anti-SARS-CoV-2: 
      A Review.
LID - 4305 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134305 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 infection, was discovered two and
      a half years ago. It caused a global pandemic, resulting in millions of deaths
      and substantial damage to the worldwide economy. Currently, only a few vaccines
      and antiviral drugs are available to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, there has been
      an increase in virus-related research, including exploring new drugs and their
      repurposing. Since discovering penicillin, natural products, particularly those
      derived from microbes, have been viewed as an abundant source of lead compounds
      for drug discovery. These compounds treat bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral
      infections. This review incorporates evidence from the available research
      publications on isolated and identified natural products derived from microbes
      with anti-hepatitis, anti-herpes simplex, anti-HIV, anti-influenza,
      anti-respiratory syncytial virus, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. About 131
      compounds with in vitro antiviral activity and 1 compound with both in vitro and 
      in vivo activity have been isolated from microorganisms, and the mechanism of
      action for some of these compounds has been described. Recent reports have shown 
      that natural products produced by the microbes, such as aurasperone A,
      neochinulin A and B, and aspulvinone D, M, and R, have potent in vitro
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, targeting the main protease (M(pro)). In the near and
      distant future, these molecules could be used to develop antiviral drugs for
      treating infections and preventing the spread of disease.

      A Virological Study Addressing HSV-1 and JPCyV.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23137194 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCPyV) are 
      widely distributed DNA viruses causing mainly asymptomatic infection, but also
      mild to very severe diseases, especially when these viruses reach the brain. Some
      drugs have been developed to inhibit HSV-1 replication in host cells, but their
      prolonged use may induce resistance phenomena. In contrast, to date, there is no 
      cure for JCPyV. The search for alternative drugs that can reduce viral infections
      without undermining the host cell is moving toward antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      of natural occurrence. These include amphibian AMPs belonging to the temporin
      family. Herein, we focus on temporin G (TG), showing that it strongly affects
      HSV-1 replication by acting either during the earliest stages of its life cycle
      or directly on the virion. Computational studies have revealed the ability of TG 
      to interact with HSV-1 glycoprotein B. We also found that TG reduced JCPyV
      infection, probably affecting both the earliest phases of its life cycle and the 
      viral particle, likely through an interaction with the viral capsid protein VP1. 
      Overall, our results are promising for the development of short naturally
      occurring peptides as antiviral agents used to counteract diseases related to
      HSV-1 and JCPyV.

TI  - Epidemiologic Implication of the Association between Herpes Simplex Virus
      Infection and the Risk of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Case-Control
      Study in Taiwan.
LID - 7832 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137832 [doi]
AB  - Enterovirus infection is a known risk factor for type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Whether 
      infection with other viruses induces T1DM remains undetermined. This study
      investigated the association between human herpesvirus (HHV) infection and the
      development of T1DM, using the data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research Database. Patients with T1DM and age- and sex-matched controls were
      included. Subjects with HHV infection were subgrouped into those with histories
      of varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus, and
      human cytomegalovirus infections. The odds ratio of the risk of T1DM was
      calculated using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Atopic
      diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and history of enterovirus infection
      served as adjusted comorbidities. Our findings suggested a significant
      association between HSV infection and the risk of T1DM (adjusted odds ratio:
      1.21; 95% CI: 1.01-1.47, p = 0.048), while infection with other HHVs was not. The
      result of HSV infection remained significant when subjects were restricted to age
      </= 18 years (adjusted odds ratio: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08-1.70, p = 0.010). We found 
      a history of HSV infection might be an independent predictive risk factor for
      T1DM. This could be potentially helpful to the practice in public health.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, proliferative disorder of
      Langerhans' cells. The presentation can vary from single organ involvement to
      multisystem and disseminated in severe cases, affecting children more than
      adults. Isolated vulvar involvement of LCH in a 28-year-old woman has rarely been
      described and also there are limited data for diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we
      report the case of a 28-year-old woman with isolated vulvar LCH, misdiagnosed
      with herpes simplex infection, successfully treated with thalidomide.

TI  - Treatment Analysis of Patients Followed up With Postherpetic Neuralgia in Nothern
      Cyprus.
PG  - 55-59
LID - 10.5455/msm.2022.33.55-59 [doi]
AB  - Background: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a frequent complication of herpes
      zoster (HZ). Treatment of this chronic pain syndrome and results are often not
      clear. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids and potent opioids are
      first-line treatments and are highly effective, but their use is limited due to
      adverse effects that may occur in elderly patients with significant medical
      comorbidities or interaction due to multiple drug use. There are no head-to-head 
      comparisons of non medical treatments. Dry needling appears comparable to
      conventional physical therapy for treating PHN. Objective: Our aim is to
      determine the incidence of PHN in our population and to compare the treatments in
      patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Methods: A search for HZ and PHN was
      conducted in a general practice research database, comprising 2 general practices
      (dermatologist and physiatrist) and representing 5600 people. We analyzed a
      retrospective 37 case with PNH of 170 herpes zoster patient admmited to the
      dermatology and physical therapy and rehabilitation outpatient clinic between
      October 2018 and October 2020. Dry needling and physical therapy methods applied 
      in addition to medical treatment in PHN treatment were compared. Results: In
      patients with postherpetic neuralgia, both dry needling therapy group and
      physical therapy group LANSS scores decreased significantly in the first week and
      in the third week compared to baseline. Dry needling therapy group has also
      similar results in VAS scores in the first and third week. But in physical
      therapy group, the VAS score did not show a significant decrease in the first
      week compared to the baseline, but it decreased significantly in the third week. 
      Conclusion: PHN is a complex, difficult to treat and severe neuropathic pain that
      affects patients' daily function and quality of life. Various agents and methods 
      are available to relieve the symptoms of PHN. This study shows as both physical
      therapy and dry needling therapy are effective treatment for postherpetic
      nevralgia..

AB  - Context: The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions across various countries varies
      from 4.9% to 64.7%. The cost barrier is an important factor that prevents people 
      in low-middle income countries from seeking professional help for dental
      problems. Aims: The present study aims to analyze the costs of medicines and oral
      care products prescribed for common oral lesions and to find the most expensive
      and the most economic brands. Methods and Material: The list of medicines and
      oral care products prescribed for the management of four oral conditions namely, 
      recurrent aphthous stomatitis, oral candidiasis, oral herpes, and gingivitis were
      taken and their median retail prices, cost variation percentages were calculated 
      from the current Indian market brands. The median retail prices were compared
      with their corresponding Jan Aushadhi prices. Also, the availability of the drugs
      and oral care products were evaluated across the state drug procurement lists of 
      Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Bihar. Results: Wide cost
      variations were seen in most of the drugs and oral care products. The Jan
      Aushadhi prices of included drugs were very economical compared to the median
      market prices. However, the availability of the drugs was less in the Jan
      Aushadhi list and also in the state medical commission lists. Conclusions: The
      availability of such commonly used drugs in oral conditions has to be ensured in 
      state and central departments by the policy makers. Price regulations of drugs
      routinely prescribed by dentists will help reduce the overall treatment costs for
      dental care.

AB  - Although herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a well-studied virus, how the virus
      invades its human host via skin and mucosa to reach its receptors and initiate
      infection remains an open question. For studies of HSV-1 infection in skin, mice 
      have been used as animal models. Murine skin infection can be induced after
      injection or scratching of the skin, which provides insights into disease
      pathogenesis but is clearly distinct from the natural entry route in human
      tissue. To explore the invasion route of HSV-1 on the tissue level, we
      established an ex vivo infection assay using skin explants. Here, we detail a
      protocol allowing the investigation of how the virus overcomes mechanical
      barriers in human skin to penetrate in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The 
      protocol includes the preparation of total skin samples, skin shaves, and of
      separated epidermis and dermis, which is followed by incubation in virus
      suspension. The ex vivo infection assay allows the visualization, quantification,
      and characterization of single infected cells in the epidermis and dermis prior
      to viral replication and the virus-induced tissue damage. Hence, this
      experimental approach enables the identification of primary viral entry portals.

TI  - An Enigmatic Case of a Febrile Infant With Seizures.
PG  - e25663
LID - 10.7759/cureus.25663 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is one of the most common viral
      infections in infants associated with high morbidity and mortality rates despite 
      available antiviral therapy. For symptomatic infants, starting empiric therapy
      with acyclovir can prevent serious neurological sequelae while awaiting results
      from diagnostic studies. The gold standard of diagnosis remains to be the
      detection of HSV DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF). However, due to the low viral load in the initial stages of infection,
      even the gold standard test may not detect active infection. We present a case of
      an eight-month-old child who presented with fever and seizures and had negative
      HSV DNA PCR from initial CSF studies. Ongoing fever and recurrent seizures
      prompted an MRI which was suggestive of meningoencephalitis, HSV DNA PCR from
      repeat CSF sample resulted positive. This case emphasizes the importance of keen 
      clinical judgment and the caution required when deciding to stop empiric therapy 
      when the clinical suspicion for HSV encephalitis remains high.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Virological diagnosis of anterior ocular herpetic disease (AOHD) is
      essential for the management of these often-chronic pathologies that may require 
      long-term therapy. PCR has become the gold standard, but the type of sampling
      (tears, corneal scraping, aqueous tap) has not been standardized. In this study, 
      we studied the technique of tear sampling for the diagnosis of AOHD. MATERIALS
      AND METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the medical files of patients with a
      positive tear sample (Schirmer strip) for herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV-1) in the
      Department of Ophthalmology of Paris-Saclay Bicetre Hospital between January 2018
      and December 2020. We studied the clinical and virological characteristics (viral
      loads) of these cases of proven AOHD. RESULTS: Thirty-six samples (33 patients)
      were included: 12 epithelial keratitis, 9 stromal HSK with ulceration, 5 uveitis,
      4 stromal HSK without ulceration, 3 blepharitis, 1 endothelial HSK, 1
      neurotrophic keratitis, and 1 conjunctivitis. The mean viral load was 3.9x10(5)
      copies/mL. Viral load was higher in cases of corneal ulceration
      (5.2x10(5)+/-9.4x10(5) versus 1.2x10(2)+/-1.7x10(2) copies/mL, P<1x10(-4)). There
      was no significant difference between primary episodes and relapses. CONCLUSION: 
      Tear sampling using Schirmer strips is a simple, non-invasive method that can be 
      useful for the virological diagnosis of various clinical forms of AOHD.

PG  - e1010629
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010629 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a large, enveloped DNA virus and its assembly
      in the cell is a complex multi-step process during which viral particles interact
      with numerous cellular compartments such as the nucleus and organelles of the
      secretory pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy
      are commonly used to study HSV-1 infection. However, 2D imaging limits our
      understanding of the 3D geometric changes to cellular compartments that accompany
      infection and sample processing can introduce morphological artefacts that
      complicate interpretation. In this study, we used soft X-ray tomography to
      observe differences in whole-cell architecture between HSV-1 infected and
      uninfected cells. To protect the near-native structure of cellular compartments
      we used a non-disruptive sample preparation technique involving rapid
      cryopreservation, and a fluorescent reporter virus was used to facilitate
      correlation of structural changes with the stage of infection in individual
      cells. We observed viral capsids and assembly intermediates interacting with
      nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. Additionally, we observed differences in the
      morphology of specific organelles between uninfected and infected cells. The
      local concentration of cytoplasmic vesicles at the juxtanuclear compartment
      increased and their mean width decreased as infection proceeded, and lipid
      droplets transiently increased in size. Furthermore, mitochondria in infected
      cells were elongated and highly branched, suggesting that HSV-1 infection alters 
      the dynamics of mitochondrial fission/fusion. Our results demonstrate that
      high-resolution 3D images of cellular compartments can be captured in a
      near-native state using soft X-ray tomography and have revealed that infection
      causes striking changes to the morphology of intracellular organelles.

AB  - The oligoclonal band indicates presence of antibodies specific to the disease,
      possibly due to the activation of certain clones of B lymphocytes. This
      intrathecal immunoglobin synthesis can be persistent for months to years, for
      example, in respons to paramyxoviruses, herpes virus, coxsackievirus, and
      Treponema pallidum; or can be synthesized for life, for example in multiple
      sclerosis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). We report a case of
      SSPE in a 15-year-old male patient. The patient had myoclonic jerks that occurred
      in the thoracal femoral region. Necessary laboratory tests identified reactive
      anti-measles IgG, which indicates a previous measles infection or exposure to
      vaccination. This report describes the usefulness of the oligoclonal bands in the
      diagnosis of the neurodegenerative disease SSPE that is progressive and fatal to 
      the central nervous system due to persistent measles virus infection in the gray 
      and white matter.

TI  - Increased Stroke Risk Following Herpes Zoster Infection and Protection with
      Zoster Vaccine.
LID - ciac549 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating stroke following varicella zoster infection are
      limited, and the utility of zoster vaccination against this phenomenon is
      unclear. PURPOSE: To determine the risk of stroke 30 days following zoster
      infection, and to evaluate the impact of zoster vaccinations on the risk of
      stroke in VZV-infected patients. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study
      was conducted from January 2010 to January 2020 utilizing nationwide patient data
      retrieved from the Veterans Affairs' Corporate Data Warehouse. RESULTS: A total
      of 2,165,505 patients 18 years of age or older who received care at a Veterans
      Affairs facility were included in the study, of which 71,911 patients had a
      history of zoster infection. Zoster patients were found to have 1.9 times
      increased likelihood of developing a stroke within 30 days following infection
      (OR: 1.93 [95% CI: 1.57-2.4] P < 0.0001). A decreased risk of stroke was seen in 
      patients who received the recombinant zoster vaccine (OR 0.57 [95% CI: 0.46-0.72]
      p < 0.0001) or the live zoster vaccine (OR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.65-0.91] p = 0.002).
      CONCLUSION: Patients had a significantly higher risk of stroke within the first
      month following recent herpes zoster infection. Receipt of at least one zoster
      vaccination was found to mitigate this increased risk. Vaccination may therefore 
      be viewed as a protective tool against the risk of neurologic post-infection
      sequelae.

AB  - Replication competent oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors have been used
      extensively to treat solid tumors with promising results. However, highly
      defective HSV vectors will be needed for applications that require sustained
      therapeutic gene expression in the absence of vector-related toxicity or
      inflammation. These vectors require complementing cell lines for their
      manufacture, creating significant challenges to achieve high yields of infectious
      virus particles. We recently described an improved upstream process for the
      production of a non-cytotoxic HSV vector for gene therapy applications. Here, we 
      sought to optimize the downstream conditions for purification and long-term
      storage of the same vector, JDeltaNI5. We compared different methods to remove
      cellular impurities and concentrate the vector by monitoring both physical and
      biological titers, resulting in the establishment of optimal conditions for
      vector production. To optimize the long-term storage parameters for non-cytotoxic
      HSV vectors, we evaluated vector stability at low temperature and sensitivity to 
      freeze-thaw cycles. We report that suboptimal purification and storage methods
      resulted in loss of vector viability. Our results describe effective and
      reproducible protocols for purification and storage of HSV vectors for
      pre-clinical studies.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients are at heightened risk for other autoimmune
      disorders, particularly Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and celiac disease (CD).
      Recent evidence suggests that target tissues of autoimmune diseases engage in a
      harmful dialogue with the immune system. However, it is unclear whether shared
      mechanisms drive similar molecular signatures at the target tissues among T1D,
      HT, and CD. In our current study, microarray datasets were obtained and mined to 
      identify gene signatures from disease-specific targeted tissues including the
      pancreas, thyroid, and intestine from individuals with T1D, HT, and CD, as well
      as their matched controls. Further, the threshold-free algorithm rank-rank
      hypergeometric overlap analysis (RRHO) was used to compare the genomic signatures
      of the target tissues of the three autoimmune diseases. Next, promising drugs
      that could potentially reverse the observed signatures in patients with two or
      more autoimmune disorders were identified using the cloud-based CLUE software
      platform. Finally, microarray data of auto-antibody positive individuals but not 
      diagnosed with T1D and single cell sequencing data of patients with T1D and HT
      were used to validate the shared transcriptomic fingerprint. Our findings
      revealed significant common gene expression changes in target tissues of the
      three autoimmune diseases studied, many of which are associated with virus
      infections, including influenza A, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, and herpes 
      simplex infection. These findings support the importance of common environmental 
      factors in the pathogenesis of T1D, HT, and CD.

AB  - Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium with focal or diffuse
      involvement. Viral infections are the most common cause of myocarditis,
      especially in Western countries. A recent viral illness with gastroenteric or
      upper respiratory symptoms often precedes myocarditis. The absence of specific
      pathognomonic features in conjunction with the wide spectrum of clinical
      manifestations that range from subclinical cases to sudden cardiac death (SCD)
      makes myocarditis diagnosis particularly challenging. Moreover, myocarditis might
      represent a cause of initially unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart
      failure (HF), especially among children and young adults. Cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging (CMR) is crucial for myocarditis diagnosis, because of its
      ability to detect interstitial edema during acute inflammation. Assessment of
      subepicardial or mid-myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is 
      typical for myocarditis. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequent events that may arise
      especially in more severe myocarditis cases. The most common form of arrhythmia
      is atrial fibrillation, followed by ventricular tachycardia. Documented
      arrhythmias have been reported more commonly with HIV myocarditis than other more
      common infections such as Adenovirus, Parvovirus B19, human Herpes virus 6, and
      Enterovirus. The mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in myocardial inflammation are
      not fully understood; in the acute phase, the spectrum of arrhythmogenesis ranges
      from a direct effect on cardiomyocytes that leads to electrical instability and
      ion channel impairment to ischemia from coronary macro- or microvascular disease.
      In chronic myocarditis, instead, myocardial replacement with fibrosis promotes
      scar-mediated re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias. Observational data suggested
      the important role of CMR, with LGE being the strongest independent predictor of 
      SCD, cardiac, and all-cause mortality. In acute myocarditis, the most common
      localization of subepicardial LGE dwells in the lateral wall. Patients with
      myocarditis that develop HF and arrhythmias usually show a larger LGE
      distribution involving several myocardial segments. Moreover, a mid-layer LGE in 
      the interventricular septum is more frequent in acute myocarditis than in acute
      coronary syndromes cases. The risk of SCD in patients with wide areas of LGE is
      significant, and a shared decision-making approach is warranted. Nevertheless,
      there is no formal consensus about the extension of LGE to justify implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in primary prevention.

TI  - beta2-Adrenergic receptor agonist enhances the bystander effect of HSV-TK/GCV
      gene therapy in glioblastoma multiforme via upregulation of connexin 43
      expression.
PG  - 76-87
LID - 10.1016/j.omto.2022.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most invasive form of primary brain
      astrocytoma. Gene therapy using the herpes simplex virus thymidine
      kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) is a new strategy for GBM treatment. As the
      connexin 43 (Cx43) levels are downregulated in GBM cells, it seems that the
      upregulation of Cx43 could improve the efficacy of the gene therapy. This study
      aims to evaluate the effect of clenbuterol hydrochloride (Cln) as a
      beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist on HSV-TK/GCV gene therapy efficacy in human
      GBM cells using olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) as vectors. The lentivirus
      containing the thymidine kinase gene was transduced to OECs and the effective
      dose of GCV on cells was measured by MTT assay. We found that Cln upregulated
      Cx43 expression in human GBM cells and OECs and promoted the cytotoxic effect of 
      GCV on the co-culture cells. Western blot results showed that Cln increased the
      cleaved caspase-3 expression and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the co-culture of GBM
      cells and OEC-TK. Also, the flow cytometry results revealed that Cln increased
      apoptosis in the co-culture of GBM cells and OEC-TK cells. This study showed that
      Cln via upregulation of Cx43 expression could enhance the bystander effect of
      HSVTK-GCV gene therapy in human GBM cells.

TI  - The complex relationship between integrins and oncolytic herpes Simplex Virus 1
      in high-grade glioma therapeutics.
PG  - 63-75
LID - 10.1016/j.omto.2022.05.013 [doi]
AB  - High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are lethal central nervous system tumors that spread
      quickly through the brain, making treatment challenging. Integrins are
      transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
      interactions, cellular adhesion, migration, growth, and survival. Their
      upregulation and inverse correlation in HGG malignancy make targeting integrins a
      viable therapeutic option. Integrins also play a role in herpes simplex virus 1
      (HSV-1) entry. Oncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) is the most clinically advanced oncolytic
      virotherapy, showing a superior safety and efficacy profile over standard cancer 
      treatment of solid cancers, including HGG. With the FDA-approval of oHSV for
      melanoma and the recent conditional approval of oHSV for malignant glioma in
      Japan, usage of oHSV for HGG has become of great interest. In this review, we
      provide a systematic overview of the role of integrins in relation to oHSV, with 
      a special focus on its therapeutic potential against HGG. We discuss the pros and
      cons of targeting integrins during oHSV therapy: while integrins play a
      pro-therapeutic role by acting as a gateway for oHSV entry, they also mediate the
      innate antiviral immune responses that hinder oHSV therapeutic efficacy. We
      further discuss alternative strategies to regulate the dual functionality of
      integrins in the context of oHSV therapy.

TI  - Survey of Physician Practices, Attitudes, and Knowledge Regarding Recombinant
      Zoster Vaccine.
LID - 10.1007/s11606-022-07721-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster vaccination rates remain low despite longstanding
      national recommendations to vaccinate immunocompetent adults aged >/= 50 years.
      The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) updated its
      recommendations for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in October 2021 to include
      immunocompromised adults aged >/=19 years. OBJECTIVE: To assess practices,
      attitudes, and knowledge about RZV, barriers to recommending RZV, and likelihood 
      of recommending RZV to patients with various immunocompromising conditions.
      DESIGN: Mail and internet-based survey conducted from May through July 2020.
      PARTICIPANTS: General internists and family physicians throughout the USA. MAIN
      MEASURES: Survey responses. KEY RESULTS: The response rate was 66% (632/955).
      Many physicians were already recommending RZV to immunocompromised populations,
      including adults >/=50 years with HIV (67% of respondents) and on recombinant
      human immune modulator therapy (56%). Forty-seven percent of respondents both
      stocked/administered RZV and referred patients elsewhere, frequently a pharmacy, 
      for vaccination; 42% did not stock RZV and only referred patients. The majority
      agreed pharmacies do not inform them when RZV has been given (64%). Physicians
      were generally knowledgeable about RZV; however, 25% incorrectly thought
      experiencing side effects from the first dose of RZV that interfere with normal
      activities was a reason to not receive the second dose. The top reported barrier 
      to recommending RZV was experience with patients declining RZV due to cost
      concerns (67%). Most physicians reported they would be likely to recommend RZV to
      immunocompromised patients. CONCLUSION: Most primary care physicians welcome
      updated ACIP RZV recommendations for immunocompromised adults. Knowledge gaps,
      communication issues, and financial barriers need to be addressed to optimize
      vaccination delivery.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of HN0037, a Novel Anti-Human Herpes Simplex
      Virus Inhibitor, in Healthy Volunteers.
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1138 [doi]
AB  - HN0037 is a helicase-primase inhibitor developed to treat herpes simplex virus
      (HSV) infection. This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of HN0037, following oral administration in healthy volunteers. 
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study comprised two parts. In part
      1, a single escalating dose of 10, 30, 60, 120, 200, 300, and 400 mg was
      assessed, and the food effect was evaluated in the 200-mg cohort. In part 2, a
      multiple dose evaluation involving 30 and 100 mg once a day was conducted for 14 
      days. Following single oral doses, the systemic exposure of HN0037 increased in a
      proportional manner over the lower dose range (10-120 mg) and in a
      subproportional manner over the higher dose range (200-400 mg). Following
      multiple oral doses, significant drug accumulation of systemic exposure was found
      at steady state, and the half-life ranged 50.4-61.0 h. The food effect study
      results indicated that a high-fat meal had a marginal impact on HN0037's
      pharmacokinetics. No differences were observed in the incidence of adverse events
      between HN0037 and placebo groups in either study. These results demonstrate that
      HN0037 is safe and well-tolerated, supporting further clinical development.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common virus of mankind and HSV-1
      infections are a significant cause of blindness. The current antiviral treatment 
      of herpes infection relies on acyclovir and related compounds. However, acyclovir
      resistance emerges especially in the long term prophylactic treatment that is
      required for prevention of recurrent herpes keratitis. Earlier we have
      established antiviral siRNA swarms, targeting sequences of essential genes of
      HSV, as effective means of silencing the replication of HSV in vitro or in vivo. 
      In this study, we show the antiviral efficacy of 2 -fluoro modified antiviral
      siRNA swarms against HSV-1 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). We studied
      HCE for innate immunity responses to HSV-1, to immunostimulatory cytotoxic double
      stranded RNA, and to the antiviral siRNA swarms, with or without a viral
      challenge. The panel of studied innate responses included interferon beta, lambda
      1, interferon stimulated gene 54, human myxovirus resistance protein A, human
      myxovirus resistance protein B, toll-like receptor 3 and interferon kappa. Our
      results demonstrated that HCE cells are a suitable model to study antiviral RNAi 
      efficacy and safety in vitro. In HCE cells, the antiviral siRNA swarms targeting 
      the HSV UL29 gene and harboring 2 -fluoro modifications, were well tolerated,
      induced only modest innate immunity responses, and were highly antiviral with
      more than 99% inhibition of viral release. The antiviral effect of the 2'-fluoro 
      modified swarm was more apparent than that of the unmodified antiviral siRNA
      swarm. Our results encourage further research in vitro and in vivo on antiviral
      siRNA swarm therapy of corneal HSV infection, especially with modified siRNA
      swarms.

AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a complication of herpes simplex virus type I 
      (HSV-1) infection causes neurological disorder or even death in immunocompromised
      adults and newborns. However, the intrinsic factors controlling the HSE outcome
      remain unclear. Here, we show that HSE mice exhibit gut microbiota dysbiosis and 
      altered metabolite configuration and tryptophan-nicotinamide metabolism. HSV-1
      neurotropic infection activated microglia, with changed immune properties and
      cell numbers, to stimulate antiviral immune response and contribute substantially
      to HSE. In addition, depletion of gut microbiota by oral antibiotics
      (ABX)-treatment triggered the hyper-activation of microglia, which in turn
      enhanced inflammatory immune response, and cytokine production, resulting in
      aggregated viral burden and HSE pathology. Furthermore, exogenous administration 
      of nicotinamide n-oxide (NAMO), an oxidative product of nicotinamide derived from
      gut microbiota, to ABX-treated or untreated HSE mice significantly diminished
      microglia-mediated proinflammatory response and limited HSV-1 infection in CNS.
      Mechanistic study revealed that HSV-1 activates microglia by increasing
      mitochondrial damage via defective mitophagy, whereas microbial metabolite NAMO
      restores NAD+-dependent mitophagy to inhibit microglia activation and HSE
      progression. NAMO also prevented neuronal cell death triggered by HSV-1 infection
      or microglia-mediated microenvironmental toxicity. Finally, we show that NAMO is 
      mainly generated by neomycin-sensitive bacteria, especially Lactobacillus_gasseri
      and Lactobacillus_reuteri. Together, these data demonstrate that gut microbial
      metabolites act as intrinsic restrictive factors against HSE progression via
      regulating mitophagy in microglia, implying further exploration of bacterial or
      nutritional approaches for treating neurotropic virus-related neurodegenerative
      diseases.

TI  - Efficacy, Safety, and Predictors of Response to Pulsed Radiofrequency Therapy for
      Acute Zoster-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia Patients: A Multicenter Retrospective
      Study.
PG  - E523-E530
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scarcity of an effective and safe therapy to relieve acute
      zoster-related trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and preventing it from developing into
      trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia is well known. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is a
      novel and safe, minimally neuro-destructive technique for the treatment of acute 
      zoster-related TN, which attains satisfactory pain relief. However, this result
      is only reported by a few single-center researches. In addition, no study has
      reported the predictive factors of the analgesic effect for PRF treatment on
      acute zoster-related TN patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the
      analgesic effect of computed tomography (CT)-guided PRF for acute zoster-related 
      TN, and to explore determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of PRF based on
      clinical evidence at multiple centers. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, 
      observational clinical study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at pain
      management centers in Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing Red Cross Peace
      Orthopedic Hospital, and Beijing Puhua International Hospital. METHODS: We
      retrospectively analyzed the effects of PRF on gasserian ganglion or its
      corresponding peripheral nerve as treatment for 85 patients with acute
      zoster-related TN under CT guidance between January 2008 to March 2021. The
      response criterion was a Numeric Rating Scale score reduction of > 50% at 12
      weeks postoperatively. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to
      identify the predictive factors for a PRF positive response. RESULTS: The medical
      records of a total of 85 acute zoster-related TN patients undergoing PRF
      treatment were identified and analyzed. The effective rate was 62.4% at 12 weeks 
      postprocedure. Univariate analysis indicated that disease duration (P = 0.023),
      diabetes mellitus (P = 0.024), and treatment location (P = 0.013) were exposure
      factors for the analgesic efficacy of PRF treatment. On multivariable analysis,
      independent predictor of PRF positive response was the treatment location of the 
      gasserian ganglion (odds ratio = 3.032; 95% confidence interval = 1.153-7.927; P 
      = 0.024). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study with a small sample size.
      Optimal PRF treatment parameters, as well as pain subtypes, need to be
      investigated in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided PRF is an effective and
      safe treatment for acute zoster-related TN patients. Compared to peripheral nerve
      PRF, gasserian ganglion treatment may be more effective for patients with acute
      zoster-related TN.

TI  - Analysis of Immunity against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Zoster in
      Adult Recipients of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A
      Single-Center Experience.
PG  - 247-253
LID - 10.18926/AMO/63718 [doi]
AB  - Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) infections are more severe in immunocompromised
      hosts. Vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella zoster (VZV)
      (MMRV) is therefore recommended for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)
      recipients. However, studies on adult HCT recipients with VPD infections are
      limited. At our institution, we have systematically conducted serological MMRV
      tests as a part of check-up examinations during long-term follow-up (LTFU) after 
      HCT since 2015. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate changes in the
      serostatus between before and 2 years after allogeneic HCT. Among 161 patients,
      the pre-transplant seropositivity was 82.7% for measles, 86.8% for mumps, 84.2%
      for rubella, and 94.3% for VZV. Among 56 patients who underwent LTFU including
      serological MMRV tests at 2 years after HCT, the percentages maintaining
      seroprotective antibody levels for measles, mumps, rubella and VZV were 71.5%
      (40/56), 51.8% (29/56), 48.2% (27/56), and 60.7% (34/56), respectively.
      Vaccination was recommended for 22 patients, and 12 were vaccinated. Among the 12
      vaccinated patients, rates of seroconversion were examined in 2-6 patients for
      each of the four viruses. They were 100% (3/3) for measles, 33.3% (1/3) for
      mumps, 50% (3/6) for rubella, and 0% (0/2) for VZV. Further studies are warranted
      to clarify the effect of vaccination in adult HCT recipients.

TI  - Critically ill COVID-19 patients with neutralizing autoantibodies against type I 
      interferons have increased risk of herpesvirus disease.
PG  - e3001709
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001709 [doi]
AB  - Autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral action of type I interferons (IFNs)
      have been associated with predisposition to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19). Here, we screened for such autoantibodies in 103 critically ill
      COVID-19 patients in a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) in Switzerland. Eleven 
      patients (10.7%), but no healthy donors, had neutralizing anti-IFNalpha or
      anti-IFNalpha/anti-IFNomega IgG in plasma/serum, but anti-IFN IgM or IgA was
      rare. One patient had non-neutralizing anti-IFNalpha IgG. Strikingly, all
      patients with plasma anti-IFNalpha IgG also had anti-IFNalpha IgG in
      tracheobronchial secretions, identifying these autoantibodies at anatomical sites
      relevant for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection. Longitudinal analyses revealed patient heterogeneity in terms of
      increasing, decreasing, or stable anti-IFN IgG levels throughout the length of
      hospitalization. Notably, presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies in this critically 
      ill COVID-19 cohort appeared to predict herpesvirus disease (caused by herpes
      simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1/-2) and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV)), which has
      been linked to worse clinical outcomes. Indeed, all 7 tested COVID-19 patients
      with anti-IFN IgG in our cohort (100%) suffered from one or more herpesviruses,
      and analysis revealed that these patients were more likely to experience CMV than
      COVID-19 patients without anti-IFN autoantibodies, even when adjusting for age,
      gender, and systemic steroid treatment (odds ratio (OR) 7.28, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.14 to 46.31, p = 0.036). As the IFN system deficiency caused by
      neutralizing anti-IFN autoantibodies likely directly and indirectly exacerbates
      the likelihood of latent herpesvirus reactivations in critically ill patients,
      early diagnosis of anti-IFN IgG could be rapidly used to inform risk-group
      stratification and treatment options. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic
      continues to spread globally. The rapid dispersion of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 drives an urgent need for effective treatments,
      especially for patients who develop severe pneumonia. The excessive and
      uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has proved to be an essential 
      factor in the rapidity of disease progression, and some cytokines are
      significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Most of the upregulated cytokines
      signal through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 
      (JAK/STAT) pathway. Therefore, blocking the exaggerated release of cytokines,
      including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFNalpha/beta/gamma, by inhibiting JAK/STAT 
      signaling will, presumably, offer favorable pharmacodynamics and present an
      attractive prospect. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) can also inhibit members of the
      numb-associated kinase (NAK) family, including AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) and
      cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which regulate the angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE-2) transmembrane protein and are involved in host viral
      endocytosis. According to the data released from current clinical trials, JAKi
      treatment can effectively control the dysregulated cytokine storm and improve
      clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. There are
      still some concerns surrounding thromboembolic events, opportunistic infection
      such as herpes zoster virus reactivation, and repression of the host's type-I
      IFN-dependent immune repair for both viral and bacterial infection. However, the 
      current JAKi clinical trials of COVID-19 raised no new safety concerns except a
      slightly increased risk of herpes virus infection. In the updated WHO guideline, 
      Baricitinb is strongly recommended as an alternative to IL-6 receptor blockers,
      particularly in combination with corticosteroids, in patients with severe or
      critical COVID-19. Future studies will explore the application of JAKi to
      COVID-19 treatment in greater detail, such as the optimal timing and course of
      JAKi treatment, individualized medication strategies based on pharmacogenomics,
      and the effect of combined medications.

AB  - Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous beta herpes virus which can result in
      meningitis/ meningoencephalitis in humans. FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis
      panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) is employed in medical centers
      for the establishment of a central nervous system (CNS) infection, and HHV-6 is
      often positive. However, establishing HHV-6 as a cause of meningitis or
      encephalitis is difficult at the present time, as a polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) test alone does not establish the etiology of the CNS infection. HHV-6 can 
      be transmitted in a Mendelian fashion by integrating into the human genome
      (ciHHV-6 or chromosomally integrated HHV-6). We present a case of a 34-week
      gestational age neonate in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who tested
      positive for HHV-6 through a panel screening, presumably due to ciHHV-6
      infection. Knowledge and understanding of this phenomenon is essential in
      preventing misdiagnosis of active HHV-6 infection and subsequent unnecessary
      antiviral treatment.

      Transduction Towards CRISPR-Cas Gene Editing.
PG  - 865424
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.865424 [doi]
AB  - T cells modified for expression of Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) were the
      first gene-modified cell products approved for use in cancer immunotherapy. CAR-T
      cells engineered with gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors (RVs/LVs) targeting
      B-cell lymphomas and leukemias have shown excellent clinical efficacy and no
      malignant transformation due to insertional mutagenesis to date. Large-scale
      production of RVs/LVs under good-manufacturing practices for CAR-T cell
      manufacturing has soared in recent years. However, manufacturing of RVs/LVs
      remains complex and costly, representing a logistical bottleneck for CAR-T cell
      production. Emerging gene-editing technologies are fostering a new paradigm in
      synthetic biology for the engineering and production of CAR-T cells. Firstly, the
      generation of the modular reagents utilized for gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas 
      systems can be scaled-up with high precision under good manufacturing practices, 
      are interchangeable and can be more sustainable in the long-run through the lower
      material costs. Secondly, gene editing exploits the precise insertion of CARs
      into defined genomic loci and allows combinatorial gene knock-ins and knock-outs 
      with exciting and dynamic perspectives for T cell engineering to improve their
      therapeutic efficacy. Thirdly, allogeneic edited CAR-effector cells could
      eventually become available as "off-the-shelf" products. This review addresses
      important points to consider regarding the status quo, pending needs and
      perspectives for the forthright evolution from the viral towards gene editing
      developments for CAR-T cells.

PG  - 905350
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.905350 [doi]
AB  - Background: Traditional testing for specific microbes or categories of central
      nervous system (CNS) infectious diseases is often limited in sensitivity and
      timeliness. However, failure to initiate a timely etiological diagnosis and
      corresponding treatment in patients with neurologic infections contribute to poor
      outcomes. Case Summary: A 58 year-old male presented acutely with fever, abnormal
      mental behavior, seizures and decreased consciousness. Brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) showed an abnormal FLAIR/T2 signal mainly in the left thalamus,
      temporal lobe, insular lobe, and bilateral hippocampus. To identify the pathogen,
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of the patient was used for metagenomic
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis and multiplex polymerase chain
      reaction (mPCR). The results showed 188 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)-specific
      sequences. After acyclovir and foscarnet sodium treatment, the ratio of
      HSV-1/internal reference reads decreased from 813/493 to 695/1961, which
      coincided with clinical remission. Conclusion: This study indicates that mNGS
      combined with mPCR may be an effective method for etiological diagnostic and
      dynamic clinical surveillance for HSV-1 encephalitis.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes condyloma acuminata (CA). Podophyllin
      is the standard treatment. Clinacanthus nutans Lindau (C. nutans), a medicinal
      plant, has potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. C. nutans cream is
      widely used in Thailand to treat the herpes simplex virus. We proposed that C.
      nutans might also induce CA clearance. There are no studies of C. nutans
      treatment of CA. This randomized controlled trial at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, 
      was conducted between January 2018 and December 2019. CA samples were obtained
      from 10 men with at least two CAs 1 centimeter apart. Each wart was randomized to
      a 4-week treatment with either C. nutans or podophyllin. The participants were 24
      to 72 years old. Most HPV types were low-risk HPVs (HPV 11, HPV 6). Median CA
      clearance with podophyllin was a 97% CA clearance with podophyllin and 82% with
      C. nutans. C. nutans may be an alternative treatment for CA.

TI  - Cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination in Turkey: A multicenter study.
LID - 10.1111/jocd.15209 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study covering all of Turkey, we aimed to define cutaneous
      and systemic adverse reactions in our patient population after COVID-19
      vaccination with the Sinovac/CoronaVac (inactivated SARS-CoV-2) and
      Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional
      study included individuals presenting to the dermatology or emergency outpatient 
      clinics of a total of 19 centers after having been vaccinated with the COVID-19
      vaccines. Systemic, local injection site, and non-local cutaneous reactions after
      vaccination were identified, and their rates were determined. RESULTS: Of the
      2290 individuals vaccinated between April 15 and July 15, 2021, 2097 (91.6%)
      received the CoronaVac vaccine and 183 (8%) BioNTech. Systemic reactions were
      observed at a rate of 31.0% after the first CoronaVac dose, 31.1% after the
      second CoronaVac dose, 46.4% after the first BioNTech dose, and 46.2% after the
      second BioNTech dose. Local injection site reactions were detected at a rate of
      35.6% after the first CoronaVac dose, 35.7% after the second CoronaVac dose,
      86.9% after the first BioNTech dose, and 94.1% after the second BioNTech dose. A 
      total of 133 non-local cutaneous reactions were identified after the CoronaVac
      vaccine (2.9% after the first dose and 3.5% after the second dose), with the most
      common being urticaria/angioedema, pityriasis rosea, herpes zoster, and
      maculopapular rash. After BioNTech, 39 non-local cutaneous reactions were
      observed to have developed (24.8% after the first dose and 5% after the second
      dose), and the most common were herpes zoster, delayed large local reaction,
      pityriasis rosea, and urticaria/angioedema in order of frequency. Existing
      autoimmune diseases were triggered in 2.1% of the patients vaccinated with
      CoronaVac and 8.2% of those vaccinated with BioNTech. CONCLUSIONS: There are no
      comprehensive data on cutaneous adverse reactions specific to the CoronaVac
      vaccine. We determined the frequency of adverse reactions from the
      dermatologist's point of view after CoronaVac and BioNTech vaccination and
      identified a wide spectrum of non-local cutaneous reactions. Our data show that
      CoronaVac is associated with less harmful reactions while BioNTech may result in 
      more serious reactions, such as herpes zoster, anaphylaxis, and triggering of
      autoimmunity. However, most of these reactions were self-limiting or required
      little therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Substance P (SP) is a tachykinin expressed by various cells in the nervous and
      immune systems. SP is predominantly released by neurons and exerts its biological
      and immunological effects through the neurokinin receptors, primarily the
      neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R). SP is essential for maintaining ocular surface
      homeostasis, and its reduced levels in disorders like diabetic neuropathy disrupt
      the corneal tissue. It also plays an essential role in promoting corneal wound
      healing by promoting the migration of keratocytes. In this review, we briefly
      discuss the structure, expression, and function of SP and its principal receptor 
      NK1R. In addition, SP induces pro-inflammatory effects through autocrine or
      paracrine action on the immune cells in various ocular surface pathologies,
      including dry eye disease, herpes simplex virus keratitis, and Pseudomonas
      keratitis. We provide an in-depth review of the pathogenic role of SP in various 
      ocular surface diseases and several new approaches developed to counter the
      immune-mediated effects of SP either through modulating its production or
      blocking its target receptor.

TI  - Primary Care Professionals' Attitudes Towards Vaccination Recommendation for
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - izac129 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izac129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunization among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
      suboptimal. We sought to characterize attitudes of US primary care professionals 
      (PCPs) towards immunization practices for patients with IBD. METHODS: Using a
      web-based opt-in panel of PCPs (DocStyles survey, spring 2021, cross-sectional
      study), we assessed likelihood of PCPs' recommending influenza, pneumococcal
      disease, herpes zoster, and human papilloma virus vaccinations for IBD patients
      by PCP characteristics and availability of clinical tools. Reasons for
      unlikelihood of recommending vaccines and approaches to improve vaccine
      recommendation were examined. RESULTS: Among 1503 PCPs, 64% recommended all
      vaccines. Herpes zoster vaccine was most likely to be recommended (89.8%) and
      pneumococcal vaccine was least likely (74.0%). Clinical tools including decision 
      support based on electronic health records (EHRs; 48.9%) and staff tracking of
      patients' vaccine needs (36.3%) were significantly associated with likelihood of 
      recommending vaccines (P < .001). A greater likelihood of vaccine recommendation 
      was observed for pediatricians vs other medical specialties, group outpatient
      clinic vs other worksites, and seeing >50 patients/week (P < .05). One-third of
      PCPs were unlikely to recommend >/=1 vaccine, and the top reason reported was
      unfamiliarity with vaccine guidelines for patients with IBD (48.0%). A review of 
      guidelines or continued medical education (63.0%) and decision support from EHRs 
      (51.2%) were the most frequently selected approaches identified to improve
      certainty of vaccine recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement
      of vaccination recommendations by PCPs. Promoting continuing education and use of
      clinical tools may help support PCP immunization practices for patients with IBD.

TI  - Analysis of Efficacy and Factors Associated with Reccurence After Radiofrequency 
      Thermocoagulation in Patients with Postherpetic Neuralgia: a Long-Term
      Retrospective and Clinical Follow-Up Study.
PG  - 971-985
LID - 10.1007/s40122-022-00412-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful condition that persists
      for 1 month or more after herpes zoster rash has healed. Radiofrequency
      thermocoagulation (RF-TC) provides analgesia by destroying the dorsal root
      ganglion and blocking the pain upload pathway; nonetheless, the concomitant
      neurological-related side effects and recurrence remain a concern. METHODS: In
      this study, 228 patients with PHN in the thoracic segment treated with RF-TC of
      the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerve were included, and were followed up 
      regularly after surgery. The numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, time to
      recurrence, and intraoperative and postoperative adverse events were recorded and
      analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves and calculate 
      the cumulative effective rate and recurrence rate. Cox regression analyses were
      performed to identify factors associated with postoperative recurrence.
      Predictive models were built to assess the value of applications. RESULTS: The
      NRS scores decreased in all postoperative periods compared with preoperative
      ones. At 10-year-follow-up, recurrence was observed in 34.6% (79/228) of patients
      that underwent PHN. The main postoperative complications were numbness and
      reduced abdominal muscle strength, which gradually decreased with time, while the
      abdominal muscle strength gradually recovered. No other adverse events occurred. 
      Interval-censored multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that disease
      course, complications, pain grade, and type of RF electrode were associated with 
      a significantly higher risk of relapse. The main intraoperative adverse effect
      was a transient increase in pain during RF-TC. CONCLUSION: CT-guided RF-TC of the
      dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerve for PHN is a relatively safe and
      effective surgical option. Disease course, type of RF electrode, complications,
      and pain grade are risk factors for postoperative recurrence and can assist in
      clinical decision-making before the RF-CT procedure.

      hospitalized pediatric patients in Yunnan, China.
PG  - e29772
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029772 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infection is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. The
      purpose of this study was to identify the viruses responsible for aseptic
      meningitis to better understand the clinical presentations of this disease.
      METHOD: Between March 2009 and February 2010, we collected 297 cerebrospinal
      fluid specimens from children with aseptic meningitis admitted to a pediatric
      hospital in Yunnan (China). Viruses were detected by using "in house" real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction from these samples. Phylogenetic analyses 
      were conducted using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 7.0
      software, with the neighbor-joining method. RESULTS: Viral infection was
      diagnosed in 35 of the 297 children (11.8%). The causative viruses were
      identified to be enteroviruses in 25 cases (71.4%), varicella-zoster virus in 5
      cases (14.3%), herpes simplex virus 1 in 2 cases (5.7%), and herpes simplex virus
      2, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus 6 in 1 case each (2.9% each). Of the
      enteroviruses, coxsackievirus B5 was the most frequently detected serotype (10/25
      cases; 40.0%) and all coxsackievirus B5 strains belonged to C group. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the study, a causative virus was only found in the minority of cases, of them,
      enteroviruses were the most frequently detected viruses in patients with viral
      meningitis, followed by varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus. Our
      findings underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and etiological study of
      aseptic meningitis.

TI  - Treatment of Complications Due to Fuchs Heterochromic Iridocyclitis (FHI) - a
      Case Report.
PG  - 129-132
LID - 10.5455/aim.2022.30.129-132 [doi]
AB  - Background: Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis is a chronic, unilateral
      iridocyclitis characterized by iris heterochromia. The gradual progression of the
      disease leads to the development of cataracts, glaucoma, and, occasionally,
      vitreous infiltration. The trigger for inflammation of the iris and ciliary body 
      is still unknown. There are several as yet unconfirmed theories about the
      mechanism of occurrence, including Toxoplasma gondii infection, immune
      dysfunction, infiltration of sensitized lymphocytes, and chronic herpes virus
      infection. Objective: The aim of this article is to present a case of Fuchs
      heterochromic iridocyclitis with complications in form of glaucoma and dense
      cataract in a female patient during a standard ophthalmologic exam in our clinic.
      The next aim is to show a proper algorithm of treatment in form of carbonic
      anhydrase inhibitors antiglaucoma medication, cataract surgery with implantation 
      of the intraocular lens, yag laser capsulothomy. Case report: A 55-year-old
      patient reports to our clinic for an examination. She was informed 7 years ago by
      her ophthalmologist that her lack of vision in the right eye is irreparable.
      Ophthalmological examination as well as a positive TORCH test (elevation of IgG
      for toxoplasma gondii) lead to a diagnosis of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis
      with complications of glaucoma and dense cataract. Antiglaucoma drops are
      prescribed, PHACO surgery is performed on the right eye with implantation of the 
      intraocular lens, and yag laser capsulotomy in the follow ups. There was a
      significant improvement of the visual acuity from light sensation with uncertain 
      projection of the same on the right eye, to 0,5-0,6 Snellen scale. We also
      educated the patient of her disease as well as the importance of her treatment
      and follow up consultations. Conclusion: Due to the insidious nature of this
      condition, along with a mild chronic course, most patients with FHI are not aware
      of the subtle changes that occur in their eyes. One of the most serious
      complications of FHI is secondary glaucoma, which can cause permanent vision loss
      in patients. The main cause of poor vision in patients with FHI is caused by
      cataract formation, with a prevalence of 23% to 90.7%. We placed special emphasis
      on educating the patient about her condition and the long-term and importance of 
      regular check-ups to prevent possible recurrent or new complications.

TI  - Reactivation of Herpes Simplex Keratitis on a Corneal Graft Following SARS-CoV-2 
      mRNA Vaccination.
PG  - 146-148
LID - 10.5455/medarh.2022.76.146-148 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ocular herpes simplex is usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 
      1 (HSV-1) and less commonly by the type 2 virus (HSV-2). Ocular manifestations of
      HSV include blepharitis, conjunctivitis, lacrimal system obstruction, corneal
      involvement, and uveitis. Corneal involvement is one of the causes of loss of
      vision and can be epithelial herpetic keratitis or stromal herpetic keratitis.
      Objective: A significant population has a colonization of herpes viruses. Under
      certain circumstances, these viruses can reactivate with a significant ocular
      morbidity. Globally, COVID-19 vaccines are recommended; however, the vaccine
      safety data are limited. Case report: Herein, we reported a case of herpetic
      keratitis reactivation that occurred 2 days after receiving SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
      vaccine. The patient is a 50-year-old man who underwent penetrating keratoplasty 
      (PKP) in 2020 for corneal opacity caused by a previous herpes simplex keratitis
      in 2013. Herpetic keratitis was treated successfully with topical antiviral
      acyclovir along with topical moxifloxacin and artificial tears. After treatment, 
      prophylactic oral acyclovir was started. Conclusion: Both ophthalmologist and
      patients should be aware of this phenomenon. Long-term prophylactic antiviral
      treatment may be recommended for those patients.

TI  - General practitioner knowledge gaps regarding live attenuated zoster vaccination 
      of immunocompromised individuals: An ongoing concern?
PG  - 529-534
LID - 10.31128/AJGP-09-21-6175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax
      [CSL/Merck]) was included on the Australian National Immunisation Program from 1 
      November 2016 for adults aged 70 years, with a catch-up program for adults aged
      71-79 years. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of Australian
      general practitioners (GPs) regarding Zostavax. METHOD: A national
      cross-sectional online survey was distributed to GPs by Healthed, a private
      health education provider. RESULTS: Of 605 GPs, 502 responded to the survey
      (response rate 83%). Eighty-nine per cent were aware that Zostavax is funded and 
      recommended for adults aged 70-79 years. Approximately 10% incorrectly responded 
      that immunocompromise is not a contraindication to Zostavax, and 8% were unsure. 
      For five clinical scenarios assessing knowledge of Zostavax contraindications,
      the proportion of correct responses ranged 25-82%. DISCUSSION: While most GPs
      surveyed had good knowledge, notable gaps were identified. Further efforts are
      needed to promote awareness of recommendations, particularly for
      immunocompromised individuals. The availability of Shingrix, a non-live
      recombinant subunit zoster vaccine, in the private market provides an
      alternative, especially for immuncompromised patients.

TI  - The first Aotearoa New Zealand case of NUDT15-variant-related thiopurine-induced 
      myelotoxicity.
PG  - 93-96
AB  - A 37-year-old Han Chinese man, with a history of severe ulcerative colitis with
      incomplete response to oral glucocorticoids, was commenced on azathioprine [AZA] 
      200mg once a day. His pre-treatment thiopurine S-methyltransferase [TPMT] levels 
      were in the normal range. Eleven days later he developed symptoms of stomatitis
      and gingivitis. Chinese herbal medications were taken in an attempt to treat
      these symptoms. He presented to the emergency department with this, with normal
      vital signs. A full blood count five days post-onset of symptoms showed
      pancytopenia with an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of 0.0x10(9)/l, C-reactive
      protein was 120 mg/L. Initial chest radiograph, urinalysis and peripheral blood
      cultures were unremarkable and he was commenced on broad spectrum antibiotics and
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]. He remained an inpatient under the
      gastroenterology team for 16 days and developed infectious complications of
      herpes simplex stomatitis, oral candidiasis, dental abscess, and scalp abscess.
      On day 16 his ANC recovered to 1.0x10(9)/L and was discharged from the hospital. 
      He underwent nudix hydrolase 15 [NUDT15] genotyping and was found to have
      homozygosity for the variant NUDT15:c.415C>T. This case demonstrates the
      importance of pre-treatment testing for NUDT15 genetic variants, to predict the
      risk of severe leucopaenia, particularly in a patient of East Asian ethnicity.

TI  - Acupuncture for the Elsberg Syndrome Secondary to Varicella-Zoster Virus
      Infection: a Case Report and Brief Review.
PG  - 152-156
LID - 10.51507/j.jams.2022.15.2.152 [doi]
AB  - Elsberg syndrome (ES) is an infectious syndrome presenting with variable signs of
      acute lumbosacral radiculomyelitis. Its low recognition rate leads to
      misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Thus, some ES patients may develop
      neurological sequelae. This case described a 74-year-old woman complained of
      urinary retention, constipation, and sacral numbness after herpes zoster in the
      perianal area. She was diagnosed with ES and accepted conventional drug
      treatments and urethral catheterization. The treatment was ineffective;
      therefore, she accepted electroacupuncture six times and her symptoms completely 
      disappeared, with no recurrence of neurological disorders during 1-year
      follow-up. This shows that acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative
      therapy for ES. Nonetheless, further prospective studies are necessary to prove
      its efficacy in ES.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.26291 [doi]
AB  - This is a case of an elderly man with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma on a direct oral
      anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation who presented with weakness.
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy found herpes esophagitis and islands of salmon-colored
      mucosa suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. Biopsies showed no signs of Barrett's 
      Esophagus but returned positive for Russell bodies. This is the only reported
      case of Russell body esophagitis in the absence of Barrett's esophagus. This case
      adds to the mounting evidence that Russell body esophagitis and potentially all
      gastrointestinal Russell bodies should prompt further work-up for hematologic
      malignancy.

AB  - Diagnosis of atypical generalized forms of herpes zoster can be a challenge and
      may lead to a delay in treatment. Herpes zoster can present with atypical
      clinical manifestations, some with higher risk of complications that are
      potentially life-threatening. We describe a patient that presented with several
      ulcerated papules and plaques in a non-dermatomal distribution in whom
      disseminated cutaneous herpes zoster was proven by molecular amplification
      testing. Patients with disseminated herpes zoster should be treated initially
      with intravenous antiviral therapy, followed by oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or 
      famciclovir in most adults, with close follow-up. Earlier treatment may reduce
      the risk of developing complications and progression of visceral involvement.
      This case adds to the evolving literature related to herpes zoster, especially
      regarding patients with immunosuppressed status.

AB  - Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is an
      autoinflammatory disease caused by somatic variants in the UBA1 gene that lead to
      severe systemic inflammation and myelodysplastic syndrome. Although no standard
      therapy has been established yet, azacitidine and bone marrow transplantation
      have been reported to be promising possibilities; however, the indications for
      these treatments are problematic and not necessarily applicable to all patients. 
      We previously reported the results of short-term treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ)
      and glucocorticoids in three patients with VEXAS syndrome. In this paper, we
      report that the combination of TCZ and glucocorticoids allowed the patients to
      continue treatment for at least one year without significant disease progression.
      Glucocorticoids were able to be reduced from the start of TCZ. Adverse events
      were herpes zoster, skin ulceration after cellulitis, and decreased blood counts.
      The results suggest the significance of this treatment as a bridge therapy for
      the development of future therapies.

TI  - A surface pocket in the cytoplasmic domain of the herpes simplex virus fusogen gB
      controls membrane fusion.
PG  - e1010435
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010435 [doi]
AB  - Membrane fusion during the entry of herpesviruses is carried out by the viral
      fusogen gB that is activated by its partner protein gH in some manner. The
      fusogenic activity of gB is controlled by its cytoplasmic (or intraviral) domain 
      (gBCTD) and, according to the current model, the gBCTD is a trimeric, inhibitory 
      clamp that restrains gB in the prefusion conformation. But how the gBCTD clamp is
      released by gH is unclear. Here, we identified two new regulatory elements within
      gB and gH from the prototypical herpes simplex virus 1: a surface pocket within
      the gBCTD and residue V831 within the gH cytoplasmic tail. Mutagenesis and
      structural modeling suggest that gH V831 interacts with the gB pocket. The gB
      pocket is located above the interface between adjacent protomers, and we
      hypothesize that insertion of the gH V831 wedge into the pocket serves to push
      the protomers apart, which releases the inhibitory clamp. In this manner, gH
      activates the fusogenic activity of gB. Both gB and gH are conserved across all
      herpesviruses, and this activation mechanism could be used by other gB homologs. 
      Our proposed mechanism emphasizes a central role for the cytoplasmic regions in
      regulating the activity of a viral fusogen.

TI  - CD137 costimulation is associated with reduced herpetic stromal keratitis and
      with developing normal CD8(+) T cells in trigeminal ganglia.
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.001756 [doi]
AB  - Costimulatory interactions can be critical in developing immune responses to
      infectious agents. We recently reported that herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1)
      infections of the cornea require a functional CD28-CD80/86 interaction to not
      only reduce the likelihood of encephalitis, but also to mediate herpetic stromal 
      keratitis (HSK) following viral reactivation. In this same spirit we decided to
      determine the role that CD137 costimulation plays during HSK. Using both
      B6-CD137L(-/-) mice, as well as antagonistic and agonistic antibodies to CD137 we
      characterize the immune response and to what extent CD137 plays an important role
      during this disease. Immune responses were measured in both the cornea and in the
      trigeminal ganglia where the virus forms a latent infection. We demonstrate that 
      CD137 costimulation leads to reduced corneal disease. Interestingly, we observed 
      that lack of CD137 costimulation resulted in significantly reduced CD8(+) T
      expansion and function in the trigeminal ganglia. Finally, we showed that viruses
      that have been genetically altered to express CD137 display significantly reduced
      corneal disease, though they did present similar levels of trigeminal infection
      and peripheral virus production following reactivation of a latent infection.
      CD137 interactions lead to reduced HSK and are necessary to develop robust
      trigeminal CD8(+) T cell responses.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for
      the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has a broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic
      patients to multiorgan dysfunction and septic shock. Most of the common symptoms 
      of COVID-19 are classified as respiratory disorders, but some reports show
      neurological involvements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a case series of
      neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), were reported.
      GBS is a neuroimmune disorder with acute inflammatory radicular polyneuropathy in
      different parts of the peripheral nerve. Some studies have reported GBS as an
      inflammatory neuropathy related to various viral infections, such as
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and Zika virus. There are some
      immunomodulation approaches for the management of GBS. Studies have evaluated the
      effects of the various therapeutic approaches, including intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE), complement inhibitors, and
      corticosteroids to regulate overactivation of immune responses during GBS in
      experimental and clinical studies. In this regard, the possible association
      between GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outbreak of the current pandemic 
      and also the mentioned therapeutic approaches were reviewed.

TI  - The association of exposure to DREAMS on sexually acquiring or transmitting HIV
      amongst adolescent girls and young women living in rural South Africa.
PG  - S39-S49
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000003156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigate how risk of sexually acquiring or transmitting HIV in
      adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) changed following the real-world
      implementation of DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS free, Mentored
      and Safe) HIV prevention programme. DESIGN: A representative population-based
      prospective cohort study of AGYW living in rural KwaZulu-Natal. METHODS: Between 
      2017 and 2019, we interviewed a random sample of AGYW aged 13-22 years annually. 
      We measured exposure to DREAMS as self-reported receipt of an invitation to
      participate and/or participation in DREAMS activities that were provided by
      DREAMS implementing organizations. HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)
      statuses were ascertained through blood tests on Dried Blood Spot (DBS). We used 
      multivariable regression analysis to assess the association between exposure to
      DREAMS and risk of acquiring HIV: measured as incident HSV-2 (a proxy of sexual
      risk) and incident HIV;and the risk of sexually transmitting HIV: measured as
      being HIV positive with a detectable HIV viral load (>/=50 copie/ml) on the last 
      available DBS. We adjusted for sociodemographic, sexual relationship, and
      migration. RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred and eighty-four (86.4%) of those
      eligible agreed to participate and 2016 (92.3%) provided data for at least one
      follow-up time-point. One thousand and thirty (54%) were exposed to DREAMS;HIV
      and HSV-2 incidence were 2.2/100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI)
      1.66-2.86] and 17.3/100 person-years (95% CI 15.5-19.4), respectively. There was 
      no evidence that HSV-2 and HIV incidence were lower in those exposed to DREAMS:
      adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.76-1.23 and 0.83 (95% CI 0.46-1.52),
      respectively. HIV viral load was detectable for 169 (8.9%) respondents;there was 
      no evidence this was lower in those exposed to DREAMS with an adjusted risk
      difference, compared with those not exposed to DREAMS, of 0.99% (95% CI-1.52 to
      3.82]. Participants who lived in peri-urban/ urban setting were more likely to
      have incident HIV and transmissible HIV. Both HSV-2 incidence and the
      transmissible HIV were associated with older age and ever having sex. Findings
      did not differ substantively by respondent age group. CONCLUSION: DREAMS exposure
      was not associated with measurable reductions in risk of sexually acquiring or
      transmitting HIV amongst a representative cohort of AGYW in rural South Africa.

TI  - Trends and projections in sexually transmitted infections in people aged 45 years
      and older in England: analysis of national surveillance data.
PG  - 17579139221106348
LID - 10.1177/17579139221106348 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We describe the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and 
      HIV in people aged 45 years in England and provide future projections about the
      burden of STIs in this age group. METHODS: Analysis of national surveillance data
      in England from 2014 to 2019 for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, herpes, syphilis,
      anogenital warts and HIV was carried out. Time trends were assessed by the
      Poisson regression and reported using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Two scenarios
      were modelled to predict the number of new STI diagnoses and associated costs in 
      2040. RESULTS: In 2019, there were 37,692 new STI diagnoses in people 45 years in
      England. Between 2014 and 2019, there was a significant increase in the rate of
      new STI diagnoses in men (IRR = 1.05, p = .05) and those aged 45-64 years (IRR = 
      1.04, p = .05). Absolute numbers of new STI diagnoses in men who have sex with
      men increased by 76% between 2014 and 2019 (IRR = 1.15, p < .001). In adults aged
      50 years, the number of episodes of care for HIV increased over time (age = 50-64
      years, IRR = 1.10; age = 65+ years, IRR = 1.13; p <.001). The modelled scenarios 
      predicted an increase in STI diagnoses and costs in older people by 2040.
      CONCLUSION: STI rates in England are increasing in people aged 45 years. The
      population is ageing and older people will contribute an increasing burden to STI
      costs if this trend continues. The reasons for this trend are not fully
      understood and further longitudinal epidemiological research is needed. Sexual
      health promotion campaigns and healthcare interventions targeted at older people 
      should be prioritised.

TI  - Factors associated with severity of atopic dermatitis - a Finnish cross-sectional
      study.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severity-associated factors in atopic dermatitis (AD) have focussed
      on early onset, concomitant atopic diseases, markers of Th2-shifted inflammation 
      and filaggrin mutations. OBJECTIVES: To investigate factors associated with
      severe AD in Finnish patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre,
      cross-sectional observational study with 502 AD patients aged 4.79 to 79.90 years
      (mean 32.08 years). Disease severity was assessed with the Rajka-Langeland
      severity score and EASI and associated clinical signs were evaluated. Data
      regarding onset, relatives, atopic and other comorbidities was gathered
      retrospectively. We investigated total serum IgE-levels, a panel of filaggrin
      null mutations and functional variants of genes associated with skin barrier
      defects. RESULTS: Factors more frequent in severe AD included early onset (P =
      0.004, 95%CI 0.000-0.024), male sex (P = 0.002, 95%CI 0.000-0.11), history of
      smoking (P = 0.012, 95%CI 0.000-0.024), concomitant asthma (P = 0.001, 95%CI
      0.000-0.011), palmar hyperlinearity (P = 0.013, 95%CI 0.014-0.059), hand
      dermatitis (P = 0.020, 95%CI 0.000-0.029) and history of contact allergy (P =
      0.042, 95%CI 0.037-0.096). Body mass indices (P < 0.000, 95%CI 0.000-0.011) and
      total serum IgE-levels (P < 0.000, 95%CI 0.000-0.011) were higher in severe AD.
      No differences were observed for allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, food
      allergy, peanut allergy, prick positivity, keratosis pilaris, history of herpes
      simplex infections, filaggrin null mutations and other gene variants.
      CONCLUSIONS: Severity determinants in Finnish patients seem to be early-onset,
      male sex, smoking, overweight, concomitant asthma, palmar hyperlinearity, hand
      dermatitis and high IgE-levels. A sub-typing of patients in relation to confirmed
      severity determinants may be useful for course prediction, prognosis and targeted
      AD management.

TI  - Long-term safety and efficacy of ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis: Up to 
      5 years of follow-up in the DAYBREAK open-label extension trial.
PG  - 13524585221102584
LID - 10.1177/13524585221102584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ozanimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5 modulator,
      is approved in multiple countries for treatment of relapsing forms of MS.
      OBJECTIVE: To characterize long-term safety and efficacy of ozanimod. METHODS:
      Patients with relapsing MS who completed a phase 13 ozanimod trial were eligible 
      for an open-label extension study (DAYBREAK) of ozanimod 0.92 mg/d. DAYBREAK
      began 16 October 2015; cutoff for this interim analysis was 2 February 2021.
      RESULTS: This analysis included 2494 participants with mean 46.8 (SD 11.9; range 
      0.03362.7) months of ozanimod exposure in DAYBREAK. During DAYBREAK, 2143
      patients (85.9%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; similar in nature 
      to those in the parent trials), 298 (11.9%) had a serious TEAE, and 75 (3.0%)
      discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Serious infections (2.8%), herpes zoster
      infections (1.7%), confirmed macular edema cases (0.2%), and cardiac TEAEs (2.8%)
      were infrequent. Adjusted annualized relapse rate was 0.103 (95% confidence
      interval, 0.0860.123). Over 48 months, 71% of patients remained relapse free.
      Adjusted mean numbers of new/enlarging T2 lesions/scan and gadolinium-enhancing
      lesions were low and similar across parent trial treatment subgroups.
      CONCLUSIONS: This long-term extension of ozanimod trials confirmed a favorable
      safety/tolerability profile and sustained benefit on clinical and magnetic
      resonance imaging measures of disease activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease has been treated with
      high-dose (20 mg/kg/dose) acyclovir since 1991. AIMS: Determine the safety of
      acyclovir in infants with neonatal HSV treated with high-dose acyclovir; examine 
      the association between acyclovir dose and exposure with adverse events (AEs).
      STUDY DESIGN: We obtained demographic information and acyclovir dosing via
      medical records. Acyclovir exposure was calculated using an established
      pharmacokinetic model. SUBJECTS: Infants <120 days of age with neonatal HSV
      discharged from four academic children's hospitals. OUTCOME MEASURES: We
      identified clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
      We identified 49 infants with neonatal HSV treated with acyclovir; 42 infants had
      complete 21-day dosing information. Median mean daily dose was 59 mg/kg/day.
      Clinical AEs were common among all gestational and postnatal age groups. Rash was
      the most common clinical AE (37 %). Mild laboratory AEs occurred in 2-37 % of
      infants. The median maximum doses (mg/kg/day) were higher among infants with
      hypokalemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and thrombocytosis. For all other
      laboratory AEs, the median maximum doses for infants without events were higher
      or equal to the median maximum dose of infants with the AE. The odds of
      experiencing any clinical or laboratory AE did not differ by predicted acyclovir 
      exposure for either area under the curve (AUC) or maximum concentration (Cmax)
      (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00 [0.98, 1.03] and OR = 1.01 [0.93, 1.12], respectively).
      Although AEs were common with high-dose acyclovir exposure, severe AEs were rare.
      Acyclovir exposure was not associated with AEs.

TI  - Neurosyphilis Mimicking Herpes Simplex Encephalitis on Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging: A Case Report.
PG  - e936127
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.936127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Neurosyphilis is a central nervous system infection caused by
      Treponema pallidum, that can develop at any time after the initial infection. The
      clinical signs of neurosyphilis are very variable, as well as its radiological
      features, and it is a diagnostic challenge. Knowledge of clinical symptoms and
      correct laboratory diagnostics, combined with routine radiological examination
      and additional diagnostic tools, such as high-resolution, three-dimensional FLAIR
      sequence, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) are key to making an accurate diagnosis of neurosyphilis. CASE
      REPORT We present the clinical case of a patient who presented a 1-year history
      of vague clinical symptoms and was misdiagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV)
      encephalitis. Initial head MRI revealed extensive cerebral white matter lesions
      with cortical contrast enhancement, mainly of anterior and medial parts of the
      left temporal lobe, as typically seen in HSV encephalitis. Empirical therapy with
      acyclovir was started until a diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed with laboratory
      findings. Later, the therapy was changed to penicillin G. The patient's condition
      improved after receiving targeted treatment. A control MRI scan was performed,
      and previously detected changes in the brain had decreased significantly.
      CONCLUSIONS MRI is the imaging of choice to support the diagnosis of
      neurosyphilis. Our findings suggest that neuroimaging can play an important role 
      in indicating suspicion of syphilitic encephalitis. Enhancement of the anterior
      and medial parts of the temporal lobe is an atypical imaging finding, and it can 
      simulate an infection with HSV. Early treatment is critical to a positive
      outcome.

      mortality.
LID - S0025-7753(22)00263-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.medcli.2022.04.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV-1) reactivation have been described in
      patients with invasive mechanical ventilation and recently in patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 with higher rates of
      reactivation than were detected previously in critical care, and although the
      diagnosis of HSV-1 pneumonia is not easy, its presence is associate with an
      increase in morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study is to
      determinate if the identification of HSV-1 in lower airway of patients with ARDS 
      secondary to COVID-19 have influence in clinical outcome and mortality. METHOD:
      Two hundred twenty-four admitted patients in intensive care unit (ICU) of
      Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Toledo diagnosed of severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reviewed and were selected
      those with mechanical ventilation who had undergone (BAL). It was registered all 
      results of HSV-1 PCR (negative and positive). RESULTS: During the study period
      (November 28, 2020 to April 13, 2021) was admitted 224 patients in ICU diagnosed 
      of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Eighty-three patients of them had undergone BAL, with
      HSV-1 PCR positive result in 47 (56%), and negative result in 36 (43.4%). We
      performed pathological anatomy study in BAL samples on 26 of the total BAL
      realized. Typical cytopathic characteristics of HSV-1 were found in 13 samples
      (50%) and 11 of them (84.6%) have had HSV-1 PCR positive result. Thirty days
      mortality was significantly higher in the group of patients with HSV-1 PCR
      positive result (33.5% vs. 57.4%, P=.015). This difference was stronger in the
      group of patients with HSV-1 findings in the pathological anatomy study (30.8%
      vs. 69.2%, P=.047). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ARDS secondary to
      SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is highly associated to HSV-1 reactivation and that the
      finding of HSV-1 in lower airway is associated with a worst prognostic and with
      significantly mortality increase. It is necessary to carry out more extensive
      studies to determinate if treatment with acyclovir can improve the prognosis of
      these patients.

AB  - A man in his 20s, with irritation, pain and photophobia in the left eye, was
      clinically diagnosed with herpes simplex virus nummular keratitis at our
      institute and advised topical antivirals and corticosteroids, causing resolution 
      of active infiltrates. The infection recurred after 7 months and the patient did 
      not respond to the previous regimen, so corneal scraping was sent for
      microbiological evaluation. Gram-positive bacilli grew on culture, which were
      identified as Atopobium vaginae using VITEK 2 Compact system (bioMerieux, Marcy
      l'Etoile, France). Gatifloxacin eye drops were added based on antibiotic
      sensitivity patterns. Infiltrates resolved completely, leaving behind residual
      scars without any recurrences. This is the first reported case of corneal
      infection caused by A. vaginae, a bacterium known to reside in the urogenital
      tract. It caused secondary corneal infection in a case of recurrent herpes
      simplex keratitis. Species identification systems like VITEK 2 Compact can help
      identify such rare bacteria with great accuracy.

      Encephalopathy.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1159/000524955 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We report two cases diagnosed as acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) 
      with acute onset and various clinical manifestations. METHODS: The patients' data
      were obtained from the medical records of the Binzhou Medical University Hospital
      in Binzhou, China. The clinical symptoms, laboratory examination, neuroimaging,
      treatment, and prognosis of the 2 patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 
      We report 2 adult ANE patients with acute onset. The first symptom was fever,
      followed by symptoms and signs of damage to the central nervous system. The
      patients were infected with herpes simplex virus and influenza virus,
      respectively. The main manifestation on brain magnetic resonance imaging was a
      mixed-signal of a "three-layer structure" in the bilateral thalamus. The first
      patient died. Based on the experience of the diagnosis and treatment of the first
      patient, combined with a review of the literature, the second patient was
      immediately treated with glucocorticoid pulse therapy combined with gamma
      globulin injection. This patient's condition was controlled, and the prognosis
      was good. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the clinical symptoms, laboratory
      examination, neuroimaging evidence, and treatment experience of ANE in adults. We
      believe that the progress of the disease may be controlled, and the prognosis may
      be improved if glucocorticoid pulse therapy combined with gamma globulin
      injection is used as soon as possible.

TI  - Antiviral activity of triptolide on herpes simplex virus in vitro.
PG  - e667
LID - 10.1002/iid3.667 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) can cause diseases, especially
      amongst neonates and immunocompromised hosts. Hence, developing a novel
      anti-HSV-1 drug with low-level toxicity is vital. Triptolide (TP), a diterpenoid 
      triepoxide is a natural product with range of bioactivity qualities. METHODS: In 
      this study, viral infection was assessed in different phases of the HSV-1
      replication cycle on A549 cells, using various assays, such as adsorption
      inhibition assay, penetration inhibition assay, time-of-addition assay, and
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: The results indicate that
      TP can effectively inhibit HSV-1 infection in the lowest range of concentration. 
      TP exhibited significant inhibitory effect on HSV-1 plaque formation, with 50%
      effective concentration (EC50) of 0.05 microM. Furthermore, the time-of-addition 
      assay suggests that TP has viral inhibitory effects when it was added less than 8
      h postinfection (h.p.i.). This result is further confirmed by decline in the
      expression viral immediate-early genes (ICP4, ICP22, and ICP27) in 6 h.p.i in the
      TP-treated group compared to the control group, evaluated by real-time qPCR. The 
      Western blotting result was also consistent with the previous findings, which
      confirms that TP can positively affect ICP4 during HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The TP also showed antiviral activity against HSV-1. This dose-dependent activity
      is an indication of a particular cellular component, rather than cytotoxicity
      that has mediated its function. Finally, the result suggest a new approach for an
      effective treatment option of the HSV-1 infections.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Expressing GFP-Tagged Virion Host Shutoff (vhs) Protein
      Uncouples the Activities of RNA Degradation and Differential Nuclear Retention of
      the Virus Transcriptome.
PG  - e0192621
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01926-21 [doi]
AB  - Virion host shutoff (vhs) protein is an endoribonuclease encoded by herpes
      simplex virus 1 (HSV1). vhs causes several changes to the infected cell
      environment that favor the translation of late (L) virus proteins: cellular mRNAs
      are degraded, immediate early (IE) and early (E) viral transcripts are
      sequestered in the nucleus with polyA binding protein (PABPC1), and dsRNA is
      degraded to help dampen the PKR-dependent stress response. To further our
      understanding of the cell biology of vhs, we constructed a virus expressing vhs
      tagged at its C terminus with GFP. When first expressed, vhs-GFP localized to
      juxtanuclear clusters, and later it colocalized and interacted with its binding
      partner VP16, and was packaged into virions. Despite vhs-GFP maintaining activity
      when expressed in isolation, it failed to degrade mRNA or relocalise PABPC1
      during infection, while viral transcript levels were similar to those seen for a 
      vhs knockout virus. PKR phosphorylation was also enhanced in vhs-GFP infected
      cells, which is in line with a failure to degrade dsRNA. Nonetheless, mRNA FISH
      revealed that as in Wt but not Dvhs infection, IE and E, but not L transcripts
      were retained in the nucleus of vhs-GFP infected cells at late times. These
      results revealed that the vhs-induced nuclear retention of IE and E transcripts
      was dependent on vhs expression but not on its endoribonuclease activity,
      uncoupling these two functions of vhs. IMPORTANCE Like many viruses, herpes
      simplex virus 1 (HSV1) expresses an endoribonuclease, the virion host shutoff
      (vhs) protein, which regulates the RNA environment of the infected cell and
      facilitates the classical cascade of virus protein translation. It does this by
      causing the degradation of some mRNA molecules and the nuclear retention of
      others. Here, we describe a virus expressing vhs tagged at its C terminus with a 
      green fluorescent protein (GFP) and show that the vhs-GFP fusion protein retains 
      the physical properties of native vhs but does not induce the degradation of
      mRNA. Nonetheless, vhs-GFP maintains the ability to trap the early virus
      transcriptome in the nucleus to favor late protein translation, proving for the
      first time that mRNA degradation is not a prerequisite for vhs effects on the
      nuclear transcriptome. This virus, therefore, has uncoupled the nuclear retention
      and degradation activities of vhs, providing a new understanding of vhs during
      infection.

TI  - Human herpes simplex virus-6 (HHV-6) detection and seroprevalence among Qatari
      nationals and immigrants residing in Qatar.
PG  - 90-95
LID - 10.1016/j.ijregi.2021.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Background: Human herpes simplex virus-6 (HHV-6) is the causative agent of
      exanthema subitum. Transmission mainly occurs through salivary secretions, yet
      blood transfusions and organ transplantations have also been reported as routes
      of transmission. Studies of seroprevalence of HHV-6 in the Middle East and North 
      Africa (MENA) region and other parts of Asia are scarce. As such, this study
      aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HHV-6 among healthy blood donors in
      Qatar. Methods: In total, 620 healthy blood donors from different nationalities
      residing in Qatar, mainly from the MENA region and Southeast Asia, were tested
      using a commercial anti-HHV-6 immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay kit. In addition, HHV-6 DNA from randomly selected samples was tested and
      quantified using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
      Results: Anti-HHV-6 IgG was detected in 71.7% (445/620) [95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 68.2-75.3%] of the tested samples, while 24.3% (61/251) (95% CI 20.0-29.6%) 
      had detectable HHV-6 viraemia. Only 22.5% of individuals with positive IgG status
      had detectable HHV-6 DNA in their blood, indicating a weak association between
      viraemia and IgG positivity (P=0.08). Furthermore, no significant difference was 
      associated between HHV-6 viraemia and demographic characteristics, except for
      nationality. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of HHV-6 in Qatar was found to be
      similar to rates reported in other parts of the world.

TI  - Sophoridine Suppresses Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Infection by Blocking the
      Activation of Cellular PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Pathways.
PG  - 872505
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.872505 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous and important human pathogen 
      capable of causing significant clinical diseases ranging from skin damage to
      encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised and neonatal hosts. Currently,
      widely used nucleoside analogs, including acyclovir and penciclovir, have some
      limitations in their use due to side effects and drug resistance. Herein, we
      report sophoridine's (SRI) dramatic inhibition of HSV-1 replication in vitro. SRI
      exhibited a remarkable inhibitory influence on HSV-1 virus-induced cytopathic
      effect and plaque formation, as well as on progeny viruses in Vero and HeLa
      cells, with selection indexes (SI) of 38.96 and 22.62, respectively. Moreover,
      SRI also considerably suppressed HSV-1 replication by hindering the expression of
      viral immediate-early (ICP0 and ICP22), early (ICP8 and TK), and late (gB and gD)
      genes and the expression of viral proteins ICP0, gB, and gD. We suggest that SRI 
      can directly inactivate viral particles and block some stages in the life cycle
      of HSV-1 after adsorption. Further experiments showed that SRI downregulated the 
      cellular PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and obstructed HSV-1 replication even more.
      Most importantly, SRI markedly repressed HSV-1-induced p38 MAPK pathway
      activation. Collectively, this natural bioactive alkaloid could be a promising
      therapeutic candidate against HSV-1 via the modulation of cellular PI3K/Akt and
      p38 MAPK pathways.

TI  - A Novel Rabies Vaccine Based on a Recombinant Bovine Herpes Virus Type 1
      Expressing Rabies Virus Glycoprotein.
PG  - 931043
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.931043 [doi]
AB  - Rabies is a highly prevalent zoonotic disease and a public health threat
      worldwide. Currently licensed rabies vaccines are effective but less is known
      which would protect cattle. This study describes the construction of a novel
      recombinant bovine herpes virus type I (BHV-1) expressing rabies virus
      glycoprotein (RABV G) instead of its gE glycoprotein (gE) by CRISPR-Cas9 and
      homologous recombination technology (BHV-1-DeltagE-G). Insertion of the RABV G
      gene is stable after 20 rounds of in vitro passaging and the recombinant virus
      replicates to high titers in MDBK cells. The RABV G expresses in the recombinant 
      virus-infected cells and on the virion surface of BHV-1-DeltagE-G. One single
      immunization with BHV-1-DeltagE-G-activated dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells
      furthermore induced a protective immune response in mice against severe lethal
      challenge infection. A protective level of RABV-specific virus-neutralizing
      antibody (VNA) was detected in intramuscular immunized mice and cattle without
      any clinical symptoms. This research demonstrated that the BHV-1 vector-based
      RABV vaccine is a potential candidate for cattle.

AB  - Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is a viral condition that presents as a painful 
      vesicular rash in the trigeminal nerve dermatome. In some cases, self-limiting
      extraocular muscle palsies may occur several weeks after the onset of HZO and
      last for weeks to months. A 71-year-old man developed a debilitating binocular
      horizontal diplopia and ptosis about four weeks after the onset of HZO symptoms. 
      He had no uveitis, keratitis, or changes in visual acuity. Examination revealed
      left abducens palsy and ptosis. Symptoms resolved within eight weeks without any 
      intervention.

      developed acute reactivation of varicella-zoster virus two days after the third
      session of dry needling for the relief of long-standing pain in the hip and
      sacroiliac joints. The lesions initially presented with severe pain along lumbar 
      dermatomes with later rash development. The patient was treated with oral
      valacyclovir 1,000 mg three times daily for seven days, and the pain was
      controlled with ibuprofen. The lesions resolved two weeks later without any
      complications or sequelae.

TI  - Potential Involvement of Varicella Zoster Virus in Alzheimer's Disease via
      Reactivation of Quiescent Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) has been implicated in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), and vaccination against shingles, caused by VZV, has been found to 
      decrease the risk of AD/dementia. VZV might reside latently in brain, and on
      reactivation might cause direct damage leading to AD, as proposed for herpes
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virus strongly implicated in AD. Alternatively,
      shingles could induce neuroinflammation and thence, reactivation of HSV-1 in
      brain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate these possibilities by comparing the effects of 
      VZV and HSV-1 infection of cultured cells, and the action of VZV infection on
      cells quiescently infected with HSV-1. METHODS: We infected human-induced neural 
      stem cell (hiNSC) cultures with HSV-1 and/or VZV and sought the presence of
      AD-related phenotypes such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) and P-tau accumulation,
      gliosis, and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Cells infected with VZV did not show the
      main AD characteristics, Abeta and P-tau accumulation, which HSV-1 does cause,
      but did show gliosis and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      suggesting that VZV's action relating to AD/dementia is indirect. Strikingly, we 
      found that VZV infection of cells quiescently infected with HSV-1 causes
      reactivation of HSV-1 and consequent AD-like changes, including Abeta and P-tau
      accumulation. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the suggestion that
      shingles causes reactivation of HSV1 in brain and with the protective effects
      against AD of various vaccines, as well as the decrease in herpes labialis
      reported after certain types of vaccination. They support an indirect role for
      VZV in AD/dementia via reactivation of HSV-1 in brain.

TI  - Increasing incidence rates of sexually transmitted infections from 2010 to 2019: 
      an analysis of temporal trends by geographical regions and age groups from the
      2019 Global Burden of Disease Study.
PG  - 574
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07544-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: World Health Organization announced its goal of ending sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) epidemics by 2030. To provide a reference for
      tailored prevention strategies, we analyzed trends and differences in STIs by
      geographical regions and age groups from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: Annual number of 
      new infections and age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of syphilis,
      chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes were recorded from the
      2019 Global Burden of Disease study. We quantified the temporal trends of STIs by
      calculating changes in new infections and estimated annual percentage changes
      (EAPCs) of ASR. RESULTS: The ASRs of syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and
      genital herpes increased by 1.70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-1.78%),
      0.29% (95% CI 0.04-0.54%), 0.27% (95% CI 0.03-0.52%), and 0.40% (95% CI
      0.36-0.44%) per year from 2010 to 2019 worldwide, respectively, while that of
      gonorrhea did not. The American regions had the greatest increase in ASR for
      syphilis (tropical Latin America: EAPC, 5.72; 95% CI 5.11-6.33), chlamydia
      (high-income North America: EAPC, 1.23; 95% CI 0.73-1.73), and gonorrhea
      (high-income North America: EAPC, 0.77; 95% CI 0.12-1.41). Additionally, southern
      sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia had the greatest increase in ASR for
      trichomoniasis (EAPC, 0.88; 95% CI 0.57-1.20) and genital herpes (EAPC, 1.44; 95%
      CI 0.83-2.06), respectively. In the most recent years, the population with the
      greatest incidence of syphilis tended to be younger globally (25-29 years in 2010
      vs. 20-24 years in 2019) but older in North Africa and Middle East (20-24 year
      vs. 25-29 years); with chlamydia tended to be older in southern sub-Saharan
      Africa (25-29 years vs. 30-34 years) but younger in Australasia (40-44 years vs. 
      25-29 years); with genital herpes tended to be older in high-income North America
      (20-24 years vs. 25-29 years) and South Asia (25-29 years vs. 30-34 years).
      CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes showed a
      trend of increasing ASR from 2010 to 2019. The differences in trends by
      geographical regions and age groups point to the need for more targeted
      prevention strategies in key regions and populations.

AB  - A 23-year-old woman, who had been suffering from migraine since primary school
      age, presented with left arm paralysis three days after one such migraine attack.
      On admission, brain MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated
      high-signal-intensity lesions in the white matter of the right fronto-parietal
      lobe, and no abnormal lesions were evident in the limbic system. Although the
      patient had a fever of 38.7 degrees C, the CSF cell count was not elevated. On
      the 4(th) day, the left arm paralysis worsened, with an increase in body
      temperature to 39.8 degrees C. Brain MRI revealed that the white matter lesions
      had spread to the right postcentral gyrus and the bilateral insular cortex. Also,
      MR angiography demonstrated no spasms or dissection of the major vessels. On the 
      6(th) day, the CSF cell count was elevated to 54/mul and herpes simplex virus DNA
      was detected. Acyclovir and steroid pulse therapy ameliorated the symptoms.
      Cervical artery dissection and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction are well
      known complications of migraine attack. However, herpes simplex encephalitis
      should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with a high
      fever of unknown origin.

TI  - Modified-release nicotinamide for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in
      haemodialysis patients: 52-week efficacy and safety results of the phase III
      randomised controlled NOPHOS trial.
LID - gfac206 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that modified-release nicotinamide (NAMR) was 
      superior to placebo in reducing serum phosphate concentrations over 12 weeks in a
      large cohort of haemodialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia. Here, we report
      outcomes after 52 weeks of treatment. METHODS: NOPHOS was a phase III,
      international, randomised, controlled, double-blind trial in parallel group
      design. NAMR (250-1500 mg/d) was investigated in comparison to placebo as an
      add-on therapy to an individual therapy with approved phosphate binders. RESULTS:
      In the intention-to-treat population (NAMR: N = 539, placebo: N = 183), serum
      phosphate was significantly lower in the NAMR group compared to the placebo group
      at W24 (5.40 +/- 1.55 mg/dl vs. 5.79 +/- 1.37 mg/dl, P < 0.001) with a mean
      difference of -0.39 mg/dl [95% CI -0.66, -0.13], but was comparable between the
      groups at W52 (mean difference -0.08 [95% CI -0.36, 0.20]). In the completer
      population (N = 358), statistical significance in favour of NAMR was reached at
      W24 and W52. The treatment effect was reduced in patients with high baseline
      serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) compared to patients with low baseline
      serum iPTH. Compliant patients in the NAMR group had a more pronounced and
      sustained reduction in serum phosphate than non-compliant patients. NAMR
      treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of thrombocytopenia,
      pruritus, anaemia, and diarrhoea. Herpes zoster occurred exclusively in patients 
      randomised to NAMR. CONCLUSIONS: NAMR combined with phosphate binders
      significantly reduced serum phosphate over the first 24 weeks of treatment, but
      the treatment effect was not maintained up to W52. Non-compliance may have
      contributed to reduced long-term efficacy. Several newly identified safety
      signals warrant further evaluation.

AB  - The rising risk of lung cancer has become a primary global concern with high
      mortality and mobility. Presently, clinically used anticancer drugs show limited 
      efficacy and significant side effects. A new generation of anticancer weapons is 
      in great demand for lung cancer therapy. Herein, we have developed a novel style 
      of biomimetic zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) based on the merits of
      cell membranes derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs),
      which can navigate biological bombs herpes simplex virus type I thymidine
      kinase-encoded plasmids (pHSVtk) and ganciclovir (GCV) to treat lung cancer. The 
      biological bomb-loaded structure can kill transfected lung cancer cells and
      neighboring lung cancer cells through the "bystander effect," which induces
      efficient suppression of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The biomimetic
      nanoparticles show an enhanced circulation lifetime and drug accumulation in the 
      tumor tissues and significantly inhibit the tumors. We have developed a
      straightforward approach to deliver biological bombs with biomimetic
      metal-organic frameworks for efficient lung cancer therapy. To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first report of such a strategy for lung cancer therapy.

      Colitis: Design, Development, and Potential Position in Therapy.
PG  - 1897-1913
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S340459 [doi]
AB  - Upadacitinib is a selective small molecule that inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) type 
      1. This molecule is administrated orally and is currently approved for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriatic arthritis.
      Upadacitinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      for the induction and maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and is under investigation by the European Medicines Agency. Data
      from two induction and two maintenance Phase III randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) proved the efficacy of upadacitinib in achieving clinical and endoscopic
      remission in patients with moderate-to-severe UC, regardless of previous
      inadequate response to other biologic therapies. The most frequently reported
      adverse events in the induction trials were acne, creatine phosphokinase
      increase, nasopharyngitis, headache, and anemia, while in the maintenance studies
      nasopharyngitis, elevation of creatine phosphokinase, UC exacerbation, upper
      respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and anemia were reported. A limited
      proportion of upadacitinib-treated patients experienced adverse events of special
      interest, like herpes zoster infections or thromboembolic events, indicating a
      reliable safety profile. The aim of this review is to summarize the available
      evidence on upadacitinib in UC providing useful insights about the positioning of
      this drug in the therapeutic algorithm.

      Association?
PG  - e25195
LID - 10.7759/cureus.25195 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 disease, COVID-19 infection, is a multi-system illness that has
      afflicted people all over the world. A number of vaccines have been produced to
      combat the current COVID-19 pandemic, and a variety of side effects have been
      recorded following the vaccination. However, there are limited data on the
      negative effects of immunological reactivation following vaccination. We report
      10 incidences of herpes zoster reactivation within 7-21 days of getting the
      COVID-19 vaccination. Transient immunomodulation following vaccination, similar
      to that seen in COVID-19 illness, could be one explanation for this reactivation.
      These cases highlight the significance of continuing to examine vaccine safety
      during the COVID-19 pandemic's ongoing mass vaccination campaign. We also
      underline the importance of peripheral health professionals in the management and
      reporting of any vaccination-associated adverse event.

      Strains of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1.
LID - 1290 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061290 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the only FDA- and EMA- approved oncolytic 
      virus, and accordingly, many potential oncolytic HSVs (oHSV) are in clinical
      development. The utilized oHSV parental strains are, however, mostly based on
      laboratory reference strains, which may possess a compromised cytolytic capacity 
      in contrast to circulating strains of HSV-1. Here, we assess the phenotype of
      thirty-six circulating HSV-1 strains from Finland to uncover their potential as
      oHSV backbones. First, we determined their capacity for cell-to-cell versus
      extracellular spread, to find strains with replication profiles favorable for
      each application. Second, to unfold the differences, we studied the genetic
      diversity of two relevant viral glycoproteins (gB/UL27, gI/US7). Third, we
      examined the oncolytic potential of the strains in cells representing glioma,
      lymphoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma. Our results suggest that the phenotype
      of a circulating isolate, including the oncolytic potential, is highly related to
      the host cell type. Nevertheless, we identified isolates with increased oncolytic
      potential in comparison with the reference viruses across many or all of the
      studied cancer cell types. Our research emphasizes the need for careful selection
      of the backbone virus in early vector design, and it highlights the potential of 
      clinical isolates as backbones in oHSV development.

TI  - Oleanolic Acid Derivative AXX-18 Exerts Antiviral Activity by Inhibiting the
      Expression of HSV-1 Viral Genes UL8 and UL52.

AB  - Two-thirds of the world's population is infected with HSV-1, which is closely
      associated with many diseases, such as Gingival stomatitis and viral
      encephalitis. However, the drugs that are currently clinically effective in
      treating HSV-1 are Acyclovir (ACV), Ganciclovir, and Valacyclovir. Due to the
      widespread use of ACV, the number of drug-resistant strains of ACV is increasing,
      so searching for new anti-HSV-1 drugs is urgent. The oleanolic-acid derivative
      AXX-18 showed a CC50 value of 44.69 muM for toxicity to HaCaT cells and an EC50
      value of 1.47 muM for anti-HSV-1/F. In addition, AXX-18 showed significant
      inhibition of ACV-resistant strains 153, 106, and Blue, and the anti-HSV-1
      activity of AXX-18 was higher than that of oleanolic acid. The mechanism of
      action of AXX-18 was found to be similar to that of oleanolic acid, except that
      AXX-18 could act on both the UL8 and UL52 proteins of the uncoupling
      helicase-primase enzyme, whereas oleanolic acid could only act on the UL8
      protein. We have elucidated the antiviral mechanism of AXX-18 in detail and,
      finally, found that AXX-18 significantly inhibited the formation of skin herpes. 
      In conclusion, we have explored the anti-HSV-1 activity of AXX-18 in vitro and in
      vivo as well as identification of its potential target proteins, which will
      provide a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anti-HSV-1 drugs.

AB  - A corticosteroid antagonist impairs Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) productive
      infection and explant-induced reactivation from latency, suggesting
      corticosteroids and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediate certain aspects of
      these complex virus-host interactions. GR-hormone complexes regulate
      transcription positively and negatively, in part, by binding GR response elements
      (GREs). Recent studies revealed infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), ICP4, and ICP27
      promoter/cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are cooperatively transactivated by GR and
      Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), which forms a feed-forward transcription loop. We
      hypothesized the ICP0 promoter contains independent CRMs that are transactivated 
      by GR, KLF15, and the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone (DEX). This
      hypothesis is based on the finding that the ICP0 promoter contains multiple
      transcription factor binding sites, and GR and KLF15 cooperatively transactivate 
      the full-length ICP0 promoter. ICP0 promoter sequences spanning -800 to -635
      (fragment A) were efficiently transactivated by GR, KLF15, and DEX in monkey
      kidney cells (Vero), whereas GR and DEX significantly enhanced promoter activity 
      in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A). Furthermore, ICP0 fragment B (-458 to
      -635) was efficiently transactivated by GR, KLF15, and DEX in Vero cells, but not
      Neuro-2A cells. Finally, fragment D (-232 to -24) was transactivated
      significantly in Vero cells by GR, KLF15, and DEX, whereas KLF15 and DEX were
      sufficient for transactivation in Neuro-2A cells. Collectively, these studies
      revealed efficient transactivation of three independent CRMs within the ICP0
      promoter by GR, KLF15, and/or DEX. Finally, GC-rich sequences containing
      specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites were essential for transactivation.

TI  - Variable Gene Expression in Human Ganglia Latently Infected with Varicella-Zoster
      Virus.
LID - 1250 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061250 [doi]
AB  - Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogenic human herpes virus that causes
      varicella ("chicken pox") as a primary infection, following which it becomes
      latent in neuronal cells in human peripheral ganglia. It may then reactivate to
      cause herpes zoster ("shingles"). Defining the pattern of VZV gene expression
      during latency is an important issue, and four highly expressed VZV genes were
      first identified by Randall Cohrs in 1996 using cDNA libraries. Further studies
      from both his and other laboratories, including our own, have suggested that
      viral gene expression may be more widespread than previously thought, but a
      confounding factor has always been the possibility of viral reactivation after
      death in tissues obtained even at 24 h post-mortem. Recent important studies,
      which Randall Cohrs contributed to, have clarified this issue by studying human
      trigeminal ganglia at 6 h after death using RNA-Seq methodology when a novel
      spliced latency-associated VZV transcript (VLT) was found to be mapped antisense 
      to the viral transactivator gene 61. Viral gene expression could be induced by a 
      VLT-ORF 63 fusion transcript when VZV reactivated from latency. Prior detection
      by several groups of ORF63 in post-mortem-acquired TG is very likely to reflect
      detection of the VLT-ORF63 fusion and not canonical ORF63. The contributions to
      the VZV latency field by Randall Cohrs have been numerous and highly significant.

TI  - Immunogenicity of Varicella Zoster Virus DNA Vaccines Encoding Glycoprotein E and
      Immediate Early Protein 63 in Mice.
LID - 1214 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061214 [doi]
AB  - Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus
      (VZV) from the sensory ganglia due to aging or immunosuppression. Glycoprotein E 
      (gE) is a widely used vaccine antigen for specific humoral and cellular immune
      responses. Immediate early protein 63 (IE63) is expressed during latency,
      suggesting that it is a potential antigen against HZ reactivation. In this study,
      HZ DNA vaccines encoding gE, IE63, IE63-2A-gE (where 2A is a self-cleaving
      sequence), or IE63-linker-gE were developed and investigated for immunogenicity
      in mice. The results showed that each HZ DNA vaccine induced VZV-specific
      antibody production. The neutralizing antibody titer elicited by IE63-2A-gE was
      comparable to that elicited by gE or live attenuated HZ vaccine (LAV).
      IE63-2A-gE-induced gE or IE63-specific INF-gamma(+) T cell frequencies in
      splenocytes were comparable to those of LAV. Furthermore, IE63-2A-gE, gE, or IE63
      led to a significant increase in IFN-gamma (IE63 stimulation) and IL-2 (gE
      stimulation) secretion compared to LAV, showing a Th1-biased immune response.
      Moreover, IE63-2A-gE and gE induced cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T cells compared
      to that of LAV. This study elucidates that the IE63-2A-gE DNA vaccine can induce 
      both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which provides a candidate for
      the development of an HZ vaccine.

TI  - CREB3 Plays an Important Role in HPSE-Facilitated HSV-1 Release in Human Corneal 
      Epithelial Cells.
LID - 1171 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061171 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) exploits several host factors to enhance its 
      replication and release from infected cells. It induces the production of host
      enzyme heparanase (HPSE) to aid in egress. While the mechanism by which HPSE
      assists in viral release is well-characterized, other host factors that are
      recruited along with HPSE for viral release are less well understood. In this
      study, we identify cyclic-AMP-responsive element-binding protein3 (CREB3) as a
      key player in HPSE-facilitated HSV-1 egress. When CREB3 is transiently
      upregulated in human corneal epithelial cells, HSV-1 release from the infected
      cells is correspondingly enhanced. This activity is linked to HPSE expression
      such that HPSE-transfected corneal epithelial (HCE) cells more highly express
      CREB3 than wild-type cells while the cells knocked out for HPSE show very little 
      CREB3 expression. CREB3-transfected HCE cells showed significantly higher export 
      of HPSE upon infection than wild-type cells. Our data suggests that coat protein 
      complex II (COPII), which mediates HPSE trafficking, is also upregulated via a
      CREB3-dependent pathway during HSV-1 infection. Finally, the co-transfection of
      CREB3 and HPSE in HCE cells shows the highest viral release compared to either
      treatment alone, establishing CREB3 as a key player in HPSE-facilitated HSV-1
      egress.

TI  - Simian Varicella Virus Pathogenesis in Skin during Varicella and Zoster.
LID - 1167 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061167 [doi]
AB  - Primary simian varicella virus (SVV) infection and reactivation in nonhuman
      primates is a valuable animal model in the study of varicella zoster virus
      disease [varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles)]. To understand SVV 
      pathogenesis in skin, we inoculated 10 rhesus macaques with SVV, resulting in
      varicella rash. After the establishment of latency, eight of the monkeys were
      immunosuppressed using tacrolimus with or without irradiation and prednisone and 
      two monkeys were not immunosuppressed. Zoster rash developed in all
      immunosuppressed monkeys and in one non-immunosuppressed monkey. Five monkeys had
      recurrent zoster. During varicella and zoster, SVV DNA in skin scrapings ranged
      from 50 to 10(7) copies/100 ng of total DNA and 2-127 copies/100 ng of total DNA,
      respectively. Detection of SVV DNA in blood during varicella was more frequent
      and abundant compared to that of zoster. During varicella and zoster, SVV
      antigens colocalized with neurons expressing beta-III tubulin in epidermis, hair 
      follicles, and sweat glands, suggesting axonal transport of the virus. Together, 
      we have demonstrated that both SVV DNA and antigens can be detected in skin
      lesions during varicella and zoster, providing the basis for further studies on
      SVV skin pathogenesis, including immune responses and mechanisms of peripheral
      spread.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Incidence of Selected Sexually Transmitted Viral
      Infections in Poland in 2010-2015: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 3448 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11123448 [doi]
AB  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) represent a major cause of morbidity in
      women and men worldwide. The main aim of this study was to perform a comparative 
      analysis of the incidence of sexually transmitted viral infections in 2010-2015
      in Poland, taking into account the administrative division of the country into
      provinces. This was a retrospective study. The analysed data came from the Centre
      for Health Information Systems of the Ministry of Health and the National
      Institute of Public Health-National Research Institute and constituted
      information from the epidemiological surveillance system in Poland. We collected 
      data on the incidence of the following diseases: genital herpes (HSV), genital
      warts, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency
      syndrome (AIDS). The key groups with the highest risk of infection were young
      people between 20 and 29 years of age. The reported data on the incidence of
      genital herpes in Poland (n = 3378; 1.5/100,000) showed a downward trend, which
      does not coincide with global trends. Genital warts were the most frequent
      genital infections in Poland (n = 7980; 3.46/100,000), with significant regional 
      variation. Over the analysed period, the situation of newly detected HIV
      infections seemed to be stable (n = 7144; 3.1/100,000). The incidence of these
      infections appeared to be highly correlated with urbanisation rates, which was
      not confirmed in the case of other analysed infections. The worsening epidemic
      situation with respect to sexually transmitted infections, the inefficiency of
      the current surveillance system and the reduction in funding for diagnosis and
      prevention, combined with inadequate legal solutions, make it necessary to
      undertake new legal and organisational measures aimed at improving the
      reproductive health in Poland in terms of sexually transmitted infections.

TI  - Identifying the Potential Roles of PBX4 in Human Cancers Based on Integrative
      Analysis.
LID - 822 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12060822 [doi]
AB  - PBX4 belongs to the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors
      family and acts as a transcriptional cofactor of HOX proteins participating in
      several pathophysiological processes. Recent studies have revealed that the
      dysregulation of PBX4 is closely related to multiple diseases, especially
      cancers. However, the research on PBX4's potential roles in 33 cancers from the
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is still insufficient. Therefore, we performed a
      comprehensive pan-cancer analysis to explore the roles of PBX4with multiple
      public databases. Our results showed that PBX4 was differentially expressed in 17
      types of human cancer and significantly correlated to the pathological stage,
      tumor grade, and immune and molecular subtypes. We used the Kaplan-Meier plotter 
      and PrognoScan databases to find the significant associations between PBX4
      expression and prognostic values of multiple cancers. It was also found that PBX4
      expression was statistically related to mutation status, DNA methylation, immune 
      infiltration, drug sensitivity, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.
      Additionally, we found that PBX4 was involved in different functional states of
      multiple cancers from the single-cell resolution perspective. Enrichment analysis
      results showed that PBX4-related genes were enriched in the cell cycle process,
      MAPK cascade, ncRNA metabolic process, positive regulation of GTPase activity,
      and regulation of lipase activity and mainly participated in the pathways of
      cholesterol metabolism, base excision repair, herpes simplex virus 1 infection,
      transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and Epstein-Barr virus infection.
      Altogether, our integrative analysis could help in better understanding the
      potential roles of PBX4 in different human cancers.

TI  - Antiviral Activity and Mechanisms of Seaweeds Bioactive Compounds on Enveloped
      Viruses-A Review.
LID - 385 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20060385 [doi]
AB  - In the last decades, the interest in seaweed has significantly increased.
      Bioactive compounds from seaweed's currently receive major attention from
      pharmaceutical companies as they express several interesting biological
      activities which are beneficial for humans. The structural diversity of seaweed
      metabolites provides diverse biological activities which are expressed through
      diverse mechanisms of actions. This review mainly focuses on the antiviral
      activity of seaweed's extracts, highlighting the mechanisms of actions of some
      seaweed molecules against infection caused by different types of enveloped
      viruses: influenza, Lentivirus (HIV-1), Herpes viruses, and coronaviruses.
      Seaweed metabolites with antiviral properties can act trough different pathways
      by increasing the host's defense system or through targeting and blocking virus
      replication before it enters host cells. Several studies have already established
      the large antiviral spectrum of seaweed's bioactive compounds. Throughout this
      review, antiviral mechanisms and medical applications of seaweed's bioactive
      compounds are analyzed, suggesting seaweed's potential source of antiviral
      compounds for the formulation of novel and natural antiviral drugs.

AB  - Herpes Zoster (HZ) is rare in childhood and is defined as the reactivation of the
      latent varicella-zoster virus in patients who have previously been infected with 
      varicella. When the virus affects the ophthal mic nerve it is called herpes
      zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and it can produce, among other symptoms, acute
      headache, so it must be considered as a differential diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To
      describe a clinical case of HZO in a pediatric patient and to recognize its
      clinical manifestations and their importance in the differential diagnosis of
      acute headache in children. CLINICAL CASE: Immunocompetent 11-year- old girl,
      vaccinated according to the recommended immunization schedule, excluding
      chickenpox vaccine due to past infection, presented to the emergency department
      (ED) with a 5-day long uni lateral headache. After 36 hours of hospitalization,
      she presented vesicular cutaneous lesions in her forehead, left upper eyelid, and
      nose. Positive fluorescein stain dendritic corneal lesions were iden tified in
      the ophthalmic exam. Antiviral systemic and topic therapy were set, obtaining an 
      initial good response, but later she presented complications such as postherpetic
      neuralgia one month after hospital discharge and several postherpetic neuralgia
      episodes despite treatment with gabapentin in addition to two herpes zoster
      ophthalmicus relapses with acute keratouveitis one year after the initial
      episode. CONCLUSION: It is essential to include HZO in the differential diagnosis
      of acute headache, especially when presented unilaterally and/or with ocular
      symptoms, regardless of the presence of cutaneous lesions, and even more so in
      patients with history of chickenpox infection. Those patients who were vaccinated
      against this disease in their childhood will benefit from at least partial
      protection against HZO.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of long-term tofacitinib treatment in East Asian patients
      with ulcerative colitis in OCTAVE Open.
LID - 10.1111/jgh.15923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Tofacitinib is an oral small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor 
      for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We present safety and efficacy data
      from patients from East Asia (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) in OCTAVE Open, an
      open-label, long-term extension study. METHODS: Patients in remission at OCTAVE
      Open baseline received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID); all others received
      tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Proportions and IRs (unique patients with events/100
      patient-years) were calculated for adverse events (AEs) of special interest.
      Efficacy endpoints were evaluated up to 36 months. RESULTS: In OCTAVE Open,
      105/944 patients were from East Asia (tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n = 22; tofacitinib
      10 mg BID, n = 83). Overall, 87.6% and 24.8% of patients had AEs and serious AEs,
      respectively; IRs (95% CI) for AEs of special interest were herpes zoster (HZ;
      non-serious and serious), 6.07 (3.40-10.02); serious infections, 1.47
      (0.40-3.76); opportunistic infections, 1.91 (0.62-4.45); major cardiovascular
      adverse events, 0.37 (0.01-2.04); malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin
      cancer [NMSC]), 0.37 (0.01-2.04); and NMSC, 0.00 (0.00-1.35). No deaths, venous
      thromboembolic events, or gastrointestinal perforations occurred. At month 36,
      68.2% and 54.2% of patients had a clinical response, 68.2% and 53.0% had
      endoscopic improvement, and 63.6% and 49.4% were in remission with tofacitinib 5 
      and 10 mg BID, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The HZ IR in East Asian patients was
      numerically higher versus the global study population; excluding HZ, tofacitinib 
      safety and efficacy were consistent with the global study population.

TI  - JAK1/2 Inhibitor Baricitinib Improves Skin Fibrosis and Digital Ulcers in
      Systemic Sclerosis.
PG  - 859330
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.859330 [doi]
AB  - Background: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare disabling connective tissue
      disease with few available treatment options. Diffuse cutaneous systemic
      sclerosis (dcSSc) is associated with high mortality. A previous experiment has
      shown that JAK2 inhibitor can significantly improve skin fibrosis in bleomycin
      (BLM)-induced murine model, including reducing dermal thickening and collagen
      accumulation. We aimed to describe the efficacy of oral JAK1/2 inhibitor
      baricitinib in SSc patients, especially focusing on skin fibrosis and
      microvascular manifestations. Methods: We described the different effects of oral
      selective JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3 inhibitor treatment in a BLM-induced skin fibrosis 
      mouse model. Furthermore, 10 adult patients with dcSSc were treated with
      baricitinib. We assessed the changes in modified rodman skin score (mRSS) and
      digital ulcer net burden at week 12 and 24 from baseline. We also compared the
      absolute changes in scores on the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire
      (SHAQ) and a total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)
      over a 24-week period. Results: In the experimental mouse model of skin fibrosis,
      a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ameliorated skin fibrosis, and a JAK2 inhibitor had the
      most obvious effect. Treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor also blunted the capillary
      rarefaction. We demonstrated that skin fibrosis and digital ulcers were
      significantly relieved in 10 SSc patients treated with baricitinib. The mRSS
      significantly improved at week 12 from baseline, with a mean change in mRSS of
      -8.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), -12.03 to -4.574; p = 0.0007] and improved
      greater at week 24 to -11.67 (95% CI, -16.84 to -6.496; p = 0.0008). Among the
      four patients with digital ulcers (DU), three were completely healed at week 24, 
      the number of ulcers in another patient was significantly reduced, and there was 
      no patient with new ulcers. Only one adverse event (AE) of herpes zoster was
      observed. Conclusions: Our results indicate that selective JAK1 and JAK2
      inhibitor alleviates skin fibrosis, and oral JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib is a
      potentially effective treatment for dcSSc patients with skin fibrosis and DU.
      Baricitinib was well-tolerated by most patients in this study. Additional large
      clinical trials are needed to confirm our pilot findings. Chinese Clinical Trial 
      Registry Number: ChiCTR2000030995.

      family members (two children and their parents) continuously develop varicella
      after the grandmother's herpes zoster. The unvaccinated 16-month-old infant and
      his mother developed primary varicella with atypical clinical presentation;
      however, his 28-year-old father presented with a typical generalized vesicular
      rash. His vaccinated 4-year-old sister was clinically mild, which could be
      defined as a breakthrough varicella case. They infected the same virus strain but
      presented various clinical forms.

TI  - Formulation Optimization and Evaluation of Nanocochleate Gel of Famciclovir for
      the Treatment of Herpes Zoster.
LID - 10.2174/1872210516666220622115553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster is a viral infection triggered due to the reactivation 
      of the varicella-zoster virus in the posterior dorsal root ganglion. Herpes
      zoster infections occur mostly in the facial, cervical and thoracic region of the
      body beginning with pain and resulted in the vesicular eruption. Recently, this
      infection is observed during the Covid-19 pandemic and also after the induction
      of mRNA-based vaccine for coronavirus at an extended level. Nanocochleates are
      cylindrical (cigar-shape) microstructure lipid-based versatile carriers for the
      drug delivery systems. Famciclovir is an antiviral agent employed for the
      treatment of Herpes zoster infections. OBJECTIVE: The current research aimed at
      the development of a novel nanocochleate gel of Famciclovir for the treatment of 
      herpes zoster infections with higher efficacy. METHODS: The interaction studies
      using FTIR were carried out and indicated no such interactions among the drug and
      lipids. The nanocochleates were developed using hydrogel, trapping, liposome
      before cochleate dialysis, direct calcium dialysis and binary aqueous-aqueous
      emulsion methods respectively. The 32 Box-Behnken design was applied by
      considering the concentration of lipids (phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) and
      speed of rotation as independent factors, whereas a particle size and entrapment 
      efficiency as dependable factors. RESULTS: The developed nanocochleates were
      estimated for the particle size (276.3 nm), zeta potential (-16.7 mV),
      polydispersity index (0.241), entrapment efficiency (73.87+/-0.19 %) and in-vitro
      diffusion release (>98.8 % in 10 h). The optimized batch was further converted
      into the topical gel using carbopol 940 as a gelling agent. The prepared gel was 
      smooth, rapidly spreadable with a viscosity (5998.72 cp), drug content (95.3 %)
      and remain stable during stability studies. CONCLUSION: A novel nanocochleate gel
      of Famciclovir was successfully developed for the treatment of infections
      associated with Herpes Zoster with sustained release action.

TI  - Simplexviruses Successfully Adapt to Their Host by Fine-Tuning Immune Responses.
LID - msac142 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac142 [doi]
AB  - Primate herpes simplex viruses are species-specific and relatively harmless to
      their natural hosts. However, cross-species transmission is often associated with
      severe disease, as exemplified by the virulence of macacine herpesvirus 1 (B
      virus) in humans. We performed a genome-wide scan for signals of adaptation of
      simplexviruses to their hominin hosts. Among core genes, we found evidence of
      episodic positive selection in three glycoproteins, with several selected sites
      located in antigenic determinants. Positively selected noncore genes were found
      to be involved in different immune-escape mechanisms. The herpes simplex virus
      (HSV)-1/HSV-2 encoded product (ICP47) of one of these genes is known to
      down-modulate major histocompatibility complex class I expression. This feature
      is not shared with B virus, which instead up-regulates Human Leukocyte Antigen
      (HLA)-G, an immunomodulatory molecule. By in vitro expression of different ICP47 
      mutants, we functionally characterized the selection signals. Results indicated
      that the selected sites do not represent the sole determinants of binding to the 
      transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Conversely, the amino acid 
      status at these sites was sufficient to determine HLA-G up-regulation. In fact,
      both HSV-1 and HSV-2 ICP47 induced HLA-G when mutated to recapitulate residues in
      B virus, whereas the mutated version of B virus ICP47 failed to determine HLA-G
      expression. These differences might contribute to the severity of B virus
      infection in humans. Importantly, they indicate that the evolution of ICP47 in
      HSV-1/HSV-2 led to the loss of an immunosuppressive effect. Thus, related
      simplexviruses finely tune the balance between immunosuppressive and
      immunostimulatory pathways to promote successful co-existence with their primate 
      hosts.

TI  - Diagnosis and Drug Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Based on Immune-Related
      Genes.
LID - 10.1007/s12031-022-02043-5 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder.
      Immune mechanisms play an important role in the development of PD. The purpose of
      this study was to identify potential differentially expressed immune-related
      genes (IRGs), signaling pathways, and drugs in PD, which may provide new
      diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PD. Differentially expressed genes
      (DEGs) and IRGs were respectively obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
      dataset and the ImmPort database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis
      (WGCNA) was utilized to further identify hub IRGs. Core IRGs were obtained by
      intersection of DEGs and hub genes in the module of WGCNA, followed by
      construction of diagnostic models and regulation network establishment of long
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)-miRNAs-diagnostic IRGs. Analysis of functional
      enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identification of
      related drugs of DEGs was performed. LILRB3 and CSF3R were identified as
      potential diagnostic markers for PD. Two regulatory pairs were identified based
      on LILRB3 and CSF3R, including XIST-hsa-miR-214-3p/hsa-miR-761-LILRB3 and
      XIST-hsa-miR-485-5p/hsa-miR-654-5p-CSF3R. LEP and IL1A were drug targets of
      Olanzapine. MMP9 and HSP90AB1 were drug targets of Bevacizumab. In addition, LEP 
      and MMP9 were respectively drug targets of Lovastatin and Celecoxib. Herpes
      simplex infection (involved TNFRSF1A) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 
      (involved CSF3R, LEP, and IL1A) were the most remarkably enriched signaling
      pathways of DEGs. Identified IRGs and related signaling pathways may play
      critical roles in the development of PD. Additionally, LILRB3 and CSF3R can be
      considered as potential immune-related diagnostic markers for PD. LEP, IL1A,
      MMP9, and HSP90AB1 may be regarded as immune-related therapeutic targets for PD.

TI  - Neuropathic Pain Associated with COVID-19: a Systematic Review of Case Reports.
LID - 10.1007/s11916-022-01065-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Researchers suggests that patients with COVID-19 develop
      neuropathic pain within weeks or months following infection and that patients
      with neuropathic pain and COVID-19 sometimes present with deterioration of
      neurologic complications and pain exacerbation. The objective of this systematic 
      review is to discuss the case-reports having neuropathic pain during and after
      COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Case reports that has described about
      patients getting neuropathy or neuropathic pain around the disease either
      immediately or late post COVID were included. The data was extracted and
      qualitatively synthesised. Literature was searched and 939 articles were found.
      12 articles were screened as per the eligibility criteria and finally, 6 case
      reports on neuropathic pain in Covid-19 were selected from the database and
      manual search and finalised for analysis. 2 cases of herpes zoster and post
      herpetic neuralgia, 2 cases of intense burning pain, 1 case of trigeminal
      neuralgia and 1 of brachial plexopathy included for the review. Covid 19 viral
      neurogenic invasion is something very newly discovered topic of discussion in the
      field of research. With the passage of time, more cases will emerge and more data
      will be available for research. The review is registered in Prospero with no.

TI  - A 77 Amino Acid Region in the N-Terminal Half of the HSV-1 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase
      ICP0 Contributes to Counteracting an Established Type 1 Interferon Response.
PG  - e0059322
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00593-22 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen capable of establishing
      lifelong latent infections that can reactivate under stress conditions. A viral
      immediate early protein that plays important roles in the HSV-1 lytic and latent 
      infections is the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase, ICP0. ICP0 transactivates all
      temporal classes of HSV-1 genes and facilitates viral gene expression. ICP0 also 
      impairs the antiviral effects of interferon (IFN)-beta, a component of host
      innate defenses known to limit viral replication. To begin to understand how ICP0
      allows HSV-1 to disarm the IFN-beta response, we performed genetic analyses using
      a series of ICP0 truncation mutants in the absence and presence of IFN-beta in
      cell culture. We observed that IFN-beta pretreatment of cells significantly
      impaired the replication of the ICP0 truncation mutants, n212 and n312, which
      code for the first 211 and 311 amino acids of ICP0, respectively; this effect of 
      IFN-beta correlated with decreased HSV-1 early and late gene expression. This
      increased sensitivity to IFN-beta was not as apparent with the ICP0 mutant, n389.
      Our mapping studies indicate that loss of 77 amino acids from residues 312 to 388
      in the N-terminal half of ICP0 resulted in a virus that was significantly more
      sensitive to cells pre-exposed to IFN-beta. This 77 amino acid region contains a 
      phospho-SUMO-interacting motif or -SIM, which we propose participates in ICP0's
      ability to counteract the antiviral response established by IFN-beta. IMPORTANCE 
      Interferons (IFNs) are secreted cellular factors that are induced by viral
      infection and limit replication. HSV-1 is largely refractory to the antiviral
      effects of type 1 IFNs, which are synthesized shortly after viral infection, in
      part through the activities of the viral regulatory protein, ICP0. To understand 
      how ICP0 impedes the antiviral effects of type 1 IFNs, we used a series of HSV-1 
      ICP0 mutants and examined their viral replication and gene expression levels in
      cells stimulated with IFN-beta (a type 1 IFN). Our mapping data identifies a
      discrete 77 amino acid region in the N-terminal half of ICP0 that facilitates
      HSV-1 resistance to IFN-beta. This region of ICP0 is modified by phosphorylation 
      and binds to the posttranslational modification SUMO, suggesting that HSV, and
      potentially other viruses, may counteract type 1 IFN signaling by altering SUMO
      and/or SUMO modified cellular proteins.

TI  - Risk of infections of biological and targeted drugs in patients with
      spondyloarthritis: meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 911-919
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000001928 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns exist regarding the risk of infections in patients with
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) treated with biologics. We assessed the risk of
      infections of biological and targeted drugs in patients with SpA by performing a 
      meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: A systematic
      literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane
      Library, and China Biology Medicine Disc for RCTs evaluating the risk of
      infections of biological therapy in patients with SpA from inception through
      August 9, 2021. We calculated a pooled Peto odds ratio (OR) for infections in
      biologics-treated patients vs. placebo patients. The risk of bias on the included
      RCTs was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: In total, 62 
      studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the risk of infection (Peto
      OR: 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.26, P < 0.001), serious infection 
      (Peto OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.26-2.17, P < 0.001), upper respiratory tract infection 
      (URTI) (Peto OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04-1.32, P = 0.008), nasopharyngitis (Peto OR:
      1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.42, P < 0.001), and Candida infection (Peto OR: 2.64, 95%
      CI: 1.48-4.71, P = 0.001) were increased in SpA patients treated with biologics
      compared with placebo. Sensitivity analysis based on biologics classes was
      conducted, and results demonstrated that compared with placebo, there was a
      higher risk of infection for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors (Peto OR:
      1.38, 95% CI: 1.13-1.68, P = 0.001) and interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors (Peto OR: 
      1.55, 95% CI: 1.08-2.22, P = 0.018) in axial SpA, and for Janus kinase inhibitors
      in peripheral SpA (Peto OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.14-1.69, P = 0.001); higher risk of
      serious infection for IL-17 inhibitors in peripheral SpA (Peto OR: 3.46, 95% CI: 
      1.26-9.55, P = 0.016) and axial SpA (Peto OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.38-2.91, P <
      0.001); higher risk of URTI for TNF-a inhibitors in axial SpA (Peto OR: 1.37, 95%
      CI: 1.05-1.78, P = 0.019), and for apremilast in peripheral SpA (Peto OR: 1.60,
      95% CI: 1.08-2.36, P = 0.018); higher risk of nasopharyngitis for TNF-a
      inhibitors in axial SpA (Peto OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.90, P = 0.022) and
      peripheral SpA (Peto OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.05, P = 0.013), and for IL-17
      inhibitors in axial SpA (Peto OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.82, P = 0.044); higher
      risk of herpes zoster for Janus kinase inhibitors in peripheral SpA (Peto OR:
      2.18, 95% CI: 1.03-4.62, P = 0.043); higher risk of Candida infection for IL-17
      inhibitors in peripheral SpA (Peto OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.31-4.84, P = 0.006).
      CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that biological therapy in patients with
      SpA may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections, URTI,
      nasopharyngitis, and Candida infection, which should be paid attention to in our 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Studies on the antiviral activity of chebulinic acid against dengue and
      chikungunya viruses and in silico investigation of its mechanism of inhibition.
PG  - 10397
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-13923-6 [doi]
AB  - Chebulinic acid (CA), originally isolated from the flower extract of the plant
      Terminalia chebula, has been shown to inhibit infection of herpes simplex virus-2
      (HSV-2), suggestively by inhibiting the host entry step of viral infection. Like 
      HSV-2, the dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) also use receptor
      glycosaminoglycans (GAG) to gain host entry, therefore, the activity of CA was
      tested against these viruses. Co-treatment of 8 microM CA with DENV-2 caused 2
      log decrease in the virus titer (4.0 log10FFU/mL) at 120 h post infection,
      compared to virus control (5.95 log10FFU/mL). In contrast, no inhibitory effect
      of CA was observed against CHIKV infection under any condition. The mechanism of 
      action of CA was investigated in silico by employing DENV-2 and CHIKV envelope
      glycoproteins. During docking, CA demonstrated equivalent binding at multiple
      sites on DENV-2 envelope protein, including GAG binding site, which have
      previously been reported to play a crucial role in host attachment and fusion,
      indicating blocking of these sites. However, CA did not show binding to the GAG
      binding site on envelope protein-2 of CHIKV. The in vitro and in silico findings 
      suggest that CA possesses the ability to inhibit DENV-2 infection at the entry
      stage of its infection cycle and may be developed as a potential therapeutic
      agent against it.

TI  - [A new paradigm for the development of neurodegenerative diseases on the example 
      of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.]
PG  - 263-273
AB  - The role of neuronal inflammation developing during the formation of amyloid
      plaques and Lewy bodies has been investigated. The influence of various exogenous
      and endogenous factors on the development of neuroinflammation has been
      established, but the role of various infectious agents in the development of this
      process has been much less studied. Today, the existence of a universal trigger
      mechanism of the neurodegenerative process is obvious: a specific pathogen of a
      bacterial or viral nature (including a long-term persistent in the nervous tissue
      in a latent state), reactivating, penetrates into certain cerebral structures,
      where it is influenced by either Abeta or resident macrophages of the central
      nervous system, which, in turn, are activated and induce the release of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation, 
      autophagy and neurodegeneration. Reactivation of latent, such as herpes,
      infection in individuals who are carriers of APOE4 significantly increases the
      risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Class II genes of the HLA locus (HLA II) 
      may be related to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The increase in 
      iron levels in the glia is induced by inflammation, which leads to
      neurodegeneration. Disruption of the homeostasis of redox-active metals, iron and
      copper, is an integral part of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and
      Parkinson's disease. The developing neuroinflammation leads to the
      intensification of the processes of peroxidation, oxidation of metals and the
      development of ferroptosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable viral diseases have been increasingly
      reported globally over the past few years. The burden of congenital viral
      infections, their impact on physical and mental development and the resulting
      economic loss to the family and the community are also well known. IgM antibody
      detection has been convenient in the diagnosis of acute viral infections,
      particularly in settings with limited resources where molecular tests are not
      feasible. METHODS: This is a comparative study between a chemiluminescence
      immunoassay (Liaison, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) and an enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) for the detection of IgM
      antibody against measles, mumps, rubella, CMV, EBV and HHV-1 and -2 viruses using
      a total of 345 samples. Results are expressed as agreement using kappa
      statistics. RESULTS: In this study, CLIA is perfectly comparable to ELISA for the
      detection of IgM antibodies against measles (0.86) and mumps (0.92) with a
      moderate agreement for rubella (0.52), CMV (0.57), EBV (0.50), and HHV-1 and -2
      (0.47) assays. However, a PABAK (prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa) showed 
      improved agreement for rubella (0.64), CMV (0.65), EBV (0.60), and HHV-1 and -2
      (0.88) assays. CONCLUSIONS: IgM antibody assays (CLIA and ELISA) against measles 
      and mumps virus can be comparably used depending on the laboratory setup,
      throughput and expertise.

TI  - Autophagy and Herpesvirus: A collaboration Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R2731 [doi]
AB  - Since the 1960s viral pathogenesis researchers have considered herpesviruses as
      an underlying factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reported molecular
      interactions between herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the amyloid
      precursor protein (APP), the parent of amyloid plaques pathognomonic for AD
      (Sapute-Krishnan et al., 2003 and 2006; Chen et al., 2011, Bearer and Wu, 2019). 
      Furthermore, others report biochemical interactions between HSV-1 and autophagy. 
      Using several brain banks for specimens of four brain regions in post-mortems of 
      individuals with and without cognitive impairment prior to death. Readhead et al.
      2018 found molecular-genetic evidence linking activity of 6 different human
      herpesviruses to AD, including HSV-1, HSV-2, HHN6, HHN7, VZV and CMV to AD. Of
      these, HHN6, a common virus causing a minor childhood illness thought to be a
      nuisance, emerged as most significant. Using a quantitative trait loci approach, 
      a network of candidate AD-associated genes were found that correlated with viral 
      load and activity. These ontology networks did not specifically consider
      autophagy genes. Our hypothesis is that viral replication and egress highjacks
      cellular membrane systems and thereby alters autophagic function. Those
      individuals carrying genetic variations that protect against this dynamic will be
      less vulnerable to cognitive impairment despite viral load, or viral load will be
      diminished. Here we first prepared lists of autophagy genes (ATG), including 180 
      we uniquely identified through machine learning, as well as lists from
      publications (Mitzushima, 2019) and websites (Autophagy Gene List, Tanpaku.org). 
      We applied software developed by Readhead et al. 2018, available through
      Synapse.com, to expression and sequence data from post-mortem brains obtained
      from publications and public sites hosted by Alzheimer's Center brain banks. We
      first determined ATG expression levels correlating with either non-AD (<1 plaque 
      per section, Braak<3, and no dementia, or pre-clinical AD, defined as Braak
      III-IV with no cognitive impairment. Virtually all ATG were down-regulated in
      pre-clinical compared to non-AD controls. Next we searched the list of
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) that correlated with increased viral load and
      activity for ATG genes from 300+ brains in the Nun's Study brain bank (ROSMAP)
      and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB). Lastly, we correlated those ATG-associated
      QTL with expression levels of these genes in control and preclinical AD (Liang et
      al. 2007, 2008 and 2010). We found that decreased ATG expression due to single
      nucleotide polymorphisms correlate with viral load and AD. This study suggests
      autophagy is a novel mechanism linking herpesvirus to AD, which may aid in
      finding new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Since HHV6 is a common infection 
      of childhood, infecting nearly 100% of humans, identifying genetic
      vulnerabilities to persistence and progression will be critically important for
      prevention of adult AD.

TI  - Resveratrol Inhibits Pseudorabies Virus Replication by Targeting IE180 Protein.
PG  - 891978
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.891978 [doi]
AB  - Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic product in red wine and peanuts and has
      many pharmacological activities in humans. Our previous studies showed that
      resveratrol has good antiviral activity against the pseudorabies virus (PRV).
      However, little is known about the antiviral mechanism of resveratrol against
      PRV. In this study, we found that resveratrol inhibited the nuclear localization 
      of IE180 protein, which is an important step for activating early/late genes
      transcription. Interestingly, the results show that resveratrol inhibited the
      activity of IE180 protein by dual-luciferase assay. Furthermore, molecular
      docking analysis shows that resveratrol could bind to the Thr601, Ser603, and
      Pro606 of IE180 protein. Point mutation assay confirmed that resveratrol lost its
      inhibition activity against the mutant IE180 protein. The results demonstrate
      that resveratrol exerts its antiviral activity against PRV by targeting the
      Thr601/Ser603/Pro606 sites of IE180 protein and inhibiting the transcriptional
      activation activity of IE180 protein. This study provides a novel insight into
      the antiviral mechanism of resveratrol against herpes viruses.

TI  - Improving Control of Gene Therapy-Based Neurotrophin Delivery for Inner Ear
      Applications.
PG  - 892969
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.892969 [doi]
AB  - Background: Survival and integrity of the spiral ganglion is vital for hearing in
      background noise and for optimal functioning of cochlear implants. Numerous
      studies have demonstrated that supplementation of supraphysiologic levels of the 
      neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3 by pumps or gene therapy strategies supports spiral
      ganglion survival. The endogenous physiological levels of growth factors within
      the inner ear, although difficult to determine, are likely extremely low within
      the normal inner ear. Thus, novel approaches for the long-term low-level delivery
      of neurotrophins may be advantageous. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate
      the long-term effects of gene therapy-based low-level neurotrophin
      supplementation on spiral ganglion survival. Using an adenovirus serotype
      28-derived adenovector delivery system, the herpes latency promoter, a weak, long
      expressing promoter system, has been used to deliver the BDNF or NTF3 genes to
      the inner ear after neomycin-induced ototoxic injury in mice. Results: Treatment 
      of the adult mouse inner ear with neomycin resulted in acute and chronic changes 
      in endogenous neurotrophic factor gene expression and led to a degeneration of
      spiral ganglion cells. Increased survival of spiral ganglion cells after
      adenoviral delivery of BDNF or NTF3 to the inner ear was observed. Expression of 
      BDNF and NT-3 could be demonstrated in the damaged organ of Corti after gene
      delivery. Hearing loss due to overexpression of neurotrophins in the normal
      hearing ear was avoided when using this novel vector-promoter combination.
      Conclusion: Combining supporting cell-specific gene delivery via the adenovirus
      serotype 28 vector with a low-strength long expressing promoter potentially can
      provide long-term neurotrophin delivery to the damaged inner ear.

AB  - Objectives: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can induce herpes zoster (HZ) and
      postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Immune cells play an important role in regulating
      HZ and PHN pathogenesis, but the dynamic immune profiles and molecular mechanisms
      remain unclear. This study aimed to screen dynamic immune signatures during HZ
      progression and elucidate the mechanism of VZV-specific T cells in PHN. Methods: 
      We used cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to analyze peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples from 45 patients with HZ and eight
      age-sex-matched healthy controls, eight PHN samples and seven non-PHN samples.
      Correlations between the immune subsets and clinical pain-related scores were
      performed. Further, the characteristics of VZV-specific T cells between PHN and
      non-PHN patients were evaluated by VZV peptide pools stimulation. The expression 
      level of cytokines, including granzyme B, interleukin (IL)-2, interferon
      (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was performed via cytometric
      bead array. Finally, we analyzed the alteration of Ca(2+) signals in dorsal root 
      ganglion (DRG)-derived cells after TNF-alpha stimulation. Results: We
      investigated the dynamic characteristics of the immune landscape of peripheral
      blood samples of patients with HZ and PHN, and depicted two major dynamic
      signatures in NK, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T subsets in patients with HZ, which closely 
      correlated with clinical pain-related scores. The frequency of PD-1(+)CD4(+) T
      cells, VZV-specific PD-1(+)CD4(+) T cells, and the amount of TNF-alpha produced
      by VZV-specific T cells were higher in patients with PHN than without PHN.
      Furthermore, we showed that TNF-alpha could induce calcium influx in DRG-derived 
      cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our results profiled the dynamic
      signatures of immune cells in patients with HZ and highlighted the important role
      of VZV-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of PHN.

      Diplegia: A Rare Variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
PG  - e25047
LID - 10.7759/cureus.25047 [doi]
AB  - Background The etiology of facial nerve palsy is diverse and includes herpes
      zoster virus, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), otitis media, Lyme disease,
      sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus, etc. The lower motor neuron type
      facial nerve palsy is usually caused by an ipsilateral facial nerve lesion;
      however, it may be caused by a central lesion of the facial nerve nucleus and
      tract in the pons. Facial diplegia is an extremely rare condition that occurs in 
      approximately 0.3% to 2.0% of all facial palsies. Electrodiagnostic studies
      including direct facial nerve conduction, facial electromyography (EMG), and
      blink reflex studies are useful for the prognosis and lesion localization in
      facial nerve palsy. Methodology This retrospective, observational study was
      conducted at the Neurophysiology Unit, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar. This 
      study included 11 patients with bilateral facial weakness who visited for
      electrodiagnostic studies in the neurophysiology laboratory. Results In total,
      eight (72.7%) patients had facial diplegia, eight (72.7%) had hypo/areflexia,
      seven (63.6%) had facial numbness, and five (45.5%) had cerebrospinal fluid
      albuminocytological dissociation. The most frequent cause of facial diplegia in
      this study was GBS (81.9%). Direct facial nerve conduction stimulation showed
      that nine (81.8%) patients had bilateral facial nerve low compound muscle action 
      potential amplitudes. The bilateral blink reflex study showed that eight (88.8%) 
      patients had absent bilateral evoked responses. Finally, the EMG study showed
      that five (55.5%) patients had active denervation in bilateral sample facial
      muscles. Conclusions Bilateral facial nerve palsy is an extremely rare condition 
      with a varied etiology. Electrodiagnostic studies are useful in detecting the
      underlying pathophysiologic processes, prognosis, and central or peripheral
      lesion localization in patients with facial diplegia.

AB  - This study aims to explore the protective effect of Forsythiae Fructus
      extract(FFE) against herpes simplex virus encephalitis(HSE) in mice. To be
      specific, life extension rate of mice, viral load in mouse brain, levels of tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), and
      interferon-alpha(IFN-alpha), and nitric oxide(NO) content in mouse brain were
      determined. Mice were classified into normal group, model group, acyclovir(ACV)
      group, and high-dose, medium-dose, and low-dose(100, 50, 25 mg.kg~(-1),
      respectively) FFE groups. HSE was induced in mice in corresponding groups. Then, 
      the life extension rate was compared among groups. Viral load in brain was
      detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, the changes of TNF-alpha,
      IL-1beta, and IFN-alpha in brain by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), NO 
      content in brain with nitrate reduction method, and pathological changes by
      hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining. The result showed that the life extension rate in
      the high-dose, medium-dose, and low-dose FFE groups was 27.93%, 19.94%, and
      10.66%, respectively, and the difference between the high-dose group and the
      model group was statistically significant(P&lt;0.05). FFE decreased the viral
      load in brains of HSE mice. The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-alpha in
      ACV group and high-dose and medium-dose FFE groups were lower than those in the
      model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05), and NO content in the three FFE groups was
      lower than that in the model group(P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, FFE can improve the
      survival rate of HSE mice, reduce the load of herpes simplex virus type (HSV-1)
      in the brains of HSE mice, decrease the levels of inflammatory factors and NO
      content, and alleviate inflammation and pathological damage, thereby protecting
      the central nervous system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid and accurate diagnosis of HSV-1 and -2 (HSV1/2) in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important for patient management. OBJECTIVES:
      Summarize the diagnostic accuracy of commercial rapid sample-to-answer PCR assays
      (results in <90 minutes, without a separate nucleic acid extraction step) for
      HSV1/2 detection in CSF. DATA SOURCES: Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus
      and CENTRAL) and five conference abstract datasets from January 2012 to March
      2022. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Diagnostic accuracy studies of FilmArray
      Meningitis-Encephalitis Panel and Simplexa HSV 1&2 Direct Kit compared to a PCR
      reference standard were included. Eligible studies provided sufficient data for
      the construction of a standard diagnostic accuracy two-by-two table.
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected meningitis and/or encephalitis. ASSESSMENT 
      OF RISK OF BIAS: Two investigators independently extracted data, rated risk of
      bias and assessed quality using QUADAS-2. METHODS: Accuracy estimates were pooled
      using Bayesian random effects models. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included
      (27 FilmArray; 4 Simplexa), comprising 9,924 samples, with 95 HSV-1 and 247 HSV-2
      infections. Pooled FilmArray sensitivities were 84.3% (95% credible interval
      72.3%-93.0%) and 92.9% (95%CrI, 82.0%-98.5%) for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively;
      specificities were 99.8% (95%CrI, 99.6%-99.9%) and 99.9% (95%CrI, 99.9%-100%).
      Pooled Simplexa sensitivities were 97.1% (95%CrI, 88.1%-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CrI,
      89.6%-99.9%), respectively; specificities were 98.9% (95%CrI, 96.8%-99.7%) and
      98.9% (95%CrI, 97.1%-99.7%). Pooled FilmArray sensitivities favored
      industry-sponsored studies by 10.0 and 13.0 percentage points for HSV-1 and
      HSV-2, respectively. Incomplete reporting frequently led to unclear risk of bias.
      Several FilmArray studies did not fully report true negative data leading to
      their exclusion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest Simplexa is accurate for HSV1/2 
      detection in CSF. Moderate FilmArray sensitivity for HSV-1 suggests additional
      testing and/or repeat CSF sampling is required for suspected HSV encephalitis
      when the HSV-1 result is negative. Low prevalence of HSV-1 infections limited
      summary estimates' precision. Underreporting of covariates limited exploration of
      heterogeneity.

TI  - Sputum characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19: report of two cases with
      immunocytochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
LID - 10.1007/s00795-022-00326-9 [doi]
AB  - Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and with severe COVID-19 often have multiple
      coinfections, and their treatment is challenging. Here, we performed cytology
      analysis on sputum samples from two patients with severe COVID-19. The specimens 
      were prepared using the rubbing method and stained with Papanicolaou stain. In
      both cases, several cells with frosted nuclei were observed, and the cytological 
      findings per 100 cells were evaluated. The infected cells were mononuclear to
      multinuclear, showing chromatin aggregation at the nuclear margins, intranuclear 
      inclusion bodies, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and mutual pressure 
      exclusion of the nuclei. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that the cells were
      positive for AE1/AE3 and negative for CD68 expression, indicating their
      epithelial origin. Furthermore, infected cells with frosted nuclei were positive 
      for surfactant protein A (SP-A) in Case 2, suggesting infection of type II
      alveolar pneumocytes or Clara cells. Moreover, in Case 2, the infected cells were
      positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) I + II and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
      confirming double infection in these cells. In conclusion, sputum cytology is an 
      important tool for determining the diversity of viral infection, and additional
      immunocytochemistry can be used for definitive diagnosis.

AB  - Various adverse effects particularly cutaneous manifestations associated with
      different COVID-19 vaccines have been observed in practice. The aim of our study 
      was to evaluate all patients who presented to our tertiary center with skin
      manifestations following COVID-19 vaccines injection from September to December
      2021. All patients with skin manifestation within 30 days or less following
      COVID-19 vaccination were enrolled in our case-series. All cases included in our 
      study were diagnosed based on clinical and/or histopathological evaluation and
      all other possible differential diagnoses were ruled out. Twenty-five individuals
      including 16 (64%) males and 9 (36%) females with the mean age of 47 +/- 17.62
      years (range 18-91) were enrolled in our study. Twenty-two (88%) patients
      developed lesions after Sinopharm vaccine injection and 3 (12%) cases manifested 
      lesions after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Six (24%) patients developed new-onset
      lichen planus (LP) and 1 (4%) patient manifested LP flare-up. Two (8%)
      individuals developed psoriasis and 1 (4%) case showed psoriasis exacerbation.
      One (4%) patient developed new-onset pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and 1 (4%) case
      experienced a flare of PV lesions. One (4%) patient manifested pityriasis
      lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) flare-up. Other new-onset cases were
      as follows: toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (n = 1, 4%), bullous pemphigoid (BP)
      (n = 2, 8%), alopecia areata (AA) (n = 2, 8%), pytriasis rosea (n = 1, 4%),
      herpes zoster (n = 1, 4%), cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (n = 1, 4%),
      erythema multiform (EM) and urticaria (n = 3, 12%), and morphea (n = 1, 4%).
      Physicians should be aware of the possible side effects especially cutaneous
      manifestations associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

TI  - An armed oncolytic virus enhances the efficacy of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte
      therapy by converting tumors to artificial antigen-presenting cells in situ.

AB  - The full potential of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy has been
      hampered by the inadequate activation and low persistence of TILs, as well as
      inefficient neoantigen presentation by tumors. We transformed tumor cells into
      artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) by infecting them with a herpes
      simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based oncolytic virus encoding OX40L and IL12
      (OV-OX40L/IL12) to provide local signals for optimum T cell activation. The
      infected tumor cells displayed increased expression of antigen-presenting
      cell-related markers and induced enhanced T cell activation and killing in
      coculture with TILs. Combining OV-OX40L/IL12 and TIL therapy induced complete
      tumor regression in patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic mouse tumor models
      and elicited an antitumor immunological memory. In addition, the combination
      therapy produced aAPC properties in tumor cells, activated T cells, and
      reprogrammed macrophages to a more M1-like phenotype in the tumor
      microenvironment. This combination strategy unleashes the full potential of TIL
      therapy and warrants further evaluation in clinical studies.

TI  - Childhood encephalitis in the Greater Mekong region (the SouthEast Asia
      Encephalitis Project): a multicentre prospective study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Encephalitis is a worldwide public health issue, with a substantially
      high burden among children in southeast Asia. We aimed to determine the causes of
      encephalitis in children admitted to hospitals across the Greater Mekong region
      by implementing a comprehensive state-of-the-art diagnostic procedure harmonised 
      across all centres, and identifying clinical characteristics related to patients'
      conditions. METHODS: In this multicentre, observational, prospective study of
      childhood encephalitis, four referral hospitals in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and
      Myanmar recruited children (aged 28 days to 16 years) who presented with altered 
      mental status lasting more than 24 h and two of the following minor criteria:
      fever (within the 72 h before or after presentation), one or more generalised or 
      partial seizures (excluding febrile seizures), a new-onset focal neurological
      deficit, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 5 per mL or higher, 
      or brain imaging (CT or MRI) suggestive of lesions of encephalitis. Comprehensive
      diagnostic procedures were harmonised across all centres, with first-line testing
      was done on samples taken at inclusion and results delivered within 24 h of
      inclusion for main treatable causes of disease and second-line testing was done
      thereafter for mostly non-treatable causes. An independent expert medical panel
      reviewed the charts and attribution of causes of all the included children. Using
      multivariate analyses, we assessed risk factors associated with unfavourable
      outcomes (ie, severe neurological sequelae and death) at discharge using data
      from baseline and day 2 after inclusion. This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04089436, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between July 28, 
      2014, and Dec 31, 2017, 664 children with encephalitis were enrolled. Median age 
      was 4.3 years (1.8-8.8), 295 (44%) children were female, and 369 (56%) were male.
      A confirmed or probable cause of encephalitis was identified in 425 (64%)
      patients: 216 (33%) of 664 cases were due to Japanese encephalitis virus, 27 (4%)
      were due to dengue virus, 26 (4%) were due to influenza virus, 24 (4%) were due
      to herpes simplex virus 1, 18 (3%) were due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 17
      (3%) were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17 (3%) were due to enterovirus A71,
      74 (9%) were due to other pathogens, and six (1%) were due to autoimmune
      encephalitis. Diagnosis was made within 24 h of admission to hospital for 83
      (13%) of 664 children. 119 (18%) children had treatable conditions and 276 (42%) 
      had conditions that could have been preventable by vaccination. At time of
      discharge, 153 (23%) of 664 children had severe neurological sequelae and 83
      (13%) had died. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for unfavourable outcome
      were diagnosis of M tuberculosis infection upon admission (odds ratio 3.23 [95%
      CI 1.04-10.03]), coma on day 2 (2.90 [1.78-4.72]), supplementary oxygen
      requirement (1.89 [1.25-2.86]), and more than 1 week duration between symptom
      onset and admission to hospital (3.03 [1.68-5.48]). At 1 year after inclusion, of
      432 children who were discharged alive from hospital with follow-up data, 24 (5%)
      had died, 129 (30%) had neurological sequelae, and 279 (65%) had completely
      recovered. INTERPRETATION: In southeast Asia, most causes of childhood
      encephalitis are either preventable or treatable, with Japanese encephalitis
      virus being the most common cause. We provide crucial information that could
      guide public health policy to improve diagnostic, vaccination, and early
      therapeutic guidelines on childhood encephalitis in the Greater Mekong region.

TI  - Combination therapy of tacrolimus, high doses of glucocorticosteroids, and
      cyclophosphamide against existing historical treatment for patients in severe
      conditions of interstitial lung diseases complicated with dermatomyositis: A
      retrospective analysis.
PG  - e29108
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029108 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: The high-dose glucocorticosteroid (GC) treatment is the first choice
      for dermatomyositis complicated with interstitial lung disease (DM-ILD) but
      patients are resistant to the high-dose GC monotherapy. Besides, the high dose of
      GC, the secondary immunosuppressive agent(s) is necessary but there is
      controversy for the selection of immunosuppressive agent(s). The objectives of
      the study were to analyze the efficacy of different therapeutic options for
      DM-ILD to identify the optimal therapy. A total of 60 patients had received
      intravenous 1.0-2.0 mg/ kg/day prednisolone for DM-ILD. In severe conditions,
      patients had received oral 1 to 3 mg/day tacrolimus (TAC), 500 mg/ m2/month
      cyclophosphamide (CY), and/or 1 g/ day methylprednisolone pulse (TI cohort, n =
      24). In severe conditions, patients had received 1 g/day methylprednisolone pulse
      and 2-3 mg/ kg/day cyclosporine A (CsA) and/or 500 mg/ m2/month CY (existing
      historical treatment; CT cohort, n = 36). Patients of the TI cohort did not
      receive CsA. Patients in the CT cohort were received CY in significantly fewer
      numbers than those of the TI cohort during treatment (P = .0112). A total of 11
      (46%) patients from the TI cohort and 14 (39%) patients from the CT cohort were
      developed relapsed. At the end of the 30-months, higher numbers of patients of
      the TI cohort had an event(s) free survival than those of the CT cohort (7 (29%) 
      vs 2 (6%), P = .0229). Also, higher numbers of patients of the TI cohort had
      survived irrespective of an event(s) than those of the CT cohort (21 (87%) vs 22 
      (61%), P = .0399). Patients of the TI cohort had developed herpes zoster (2 (8%))
      and cytomegalovirus (4 (17%)) infections. Patients of the CT cohort developed
      renal dysfunction (10 (28%)). Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and fracture
      (GC-related toxicities) were also reported in both cohorts and these toxicities
      were fever in the TI cohort. The addition of TAC to high doses GC with CY is an
      ideal treatment for severe conditions of DM-ILD (Level of Evidence: III;
      Technical Efficacy Stage: 4).

TI  - Challenges in screening of sexually transmitted viral infections of the female
      genital tract: Where do we stand? - A scoping review.
PG  - 940-946
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.4166 [doi]
AB  - Globally more than a million sexually transmitted infections occur daily, and
      over 53 000 [47,000-60,000] women aged 15 and over were living with human
      immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Pakistan by the
      year 2020. This situation becomes graver when the sexually transmitted infections
      exist as co-infections while remaining undiagnosed or under-diagnosed.
      Additionally, herpetic or papillomavirus lesions are more recurrent, more
      extensive and have more serious consequences in human immunodeficiency
      virus-positive patients. Literature shows a dramatic increase in morbidity and
      mortality due to the occurrence of malignancies in genital co-infections. There
      is a key concern that every single adolescent female living in Pakistan is at a
      high risk of acquiring viral sexually transmitted infections along with
      malignancy of the cervix. As such, the health and future of this age group is
      already imperilled. Needless to mention that the practice of routine cervical
      screening and diagnostic laboratory services offered to a common woman in
      Pakistan have been less than satisfactory for decades. Therefore, to meet the
      minimum expectations regarding the Millennium Development Goals for sexual and
      reproductive health and rights 2030, it has now become imperative for the health 
      sector to develop and implement scientific and community-based policies for
      comprehensive and multidisciplinary diagnostic strategies leading to early and
      effective management of viral sexually transmitted infections and subsequent
      neoplasia.

AB  - Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, immune-mediated condition which affects the
      skin and mucous membranes. EM is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction typically
      mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It is usually a self limiting, transient,
      inflammatory disease that spontaneously resolves within weeks without major
      sequelae. However, occasionally patients might have frequent recurrences,
      persistent disease or serious complications like fluid and electrolyte
      abnormalities. The most common triggers are infection followed by medications.
      Here we present the case of an 81-year-old female who came in with worsening lip 
      and tongue swelling associated with a rash and was diagnosed with EM major due to
      naproxen.

LID - 10.5187/jast.2022.e30 [doi]
AB  - Despite vaccination, equine influenza virus (EIV) and equine herpesvirus (EHV)
      infections still cause highly contagious respiratory diseases in horses.
      Recently, concurrent vaccination with EIV and EHV was suggested as a new
      approach; however, there have been no reports of concurrent vaccination with
      recombinant canarypox EIV and inactivated EHV vaccines. In this study, we aimed
      to compare the EIV-specific immune responses induced by concurrent
      administrations of a recombinant canarypox EIV vaccine and an inactivated
      bivalent EHV vaccine with those induced by a single recombinant canarypox EIV
      vaccine in experimental horse and mouse models. Serum and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from immunized animals after
      vaccination. EIV-specific serum antibody levels, serum hemagglutinin inhibition
      (HI) titers, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels were measured by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, HI assay, and quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction, respectively. Concurrent EIV and EHV vaccine administration
      significantly increased IFN-gamma production, without compromising humoral
      responses. Our data demonstrate that concurrent vaccination with EIV and EHV
      vaccines can enhance EIV-specific cellular responses in horses.

      Sweden.
PG  - 547
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07525-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to describe the annual prevalence of herpes simplex virus
      (HSV) reactivation in relation to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and antiviral 
      drug use in the Swedish adult population. METHODS: The study comprised 2879
      anti-HSV-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G positive subjects from five different cohorts
      who had donated serum from 1988 to 2010. The sera were analyzed for anti-HSV IgM 
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between the presence of
      anti-HSV IgM antibodies, the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele and the serum
      sampling year were assessed by logistic regression. Seasonality of anti-HSV IgM
      was evaluated in a UV radiation model. Data of antiviral drugs for the entire
      Swedish population were compiled from two different nationwide databases: the
      Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Swedish Association of the
      Pharmaceutical Industry. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses
      indicated that the prevalence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies declined between 1988
      and 2010 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.912, p < .001), while the total annual use of
      antiviral drugs in Sweden gradually increased from 1984 to 2017. Higher UV
      radiation was associated with higher prevalence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies (OR = 
      1.071, p = .043). CONCLUSION: The declining time trend of HSV reactivation in a
      Swedish cohort coincides with a steady increase of antiviral drug use in the
      Swedish general population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A new recombinant herpes zoster vaccine has advanced efforts to
      prevent shingles, but its multidose regimen introduces potential barriers to full
      protection that must be managed by community pharmacies. To address this
      potential patient management challenge, a pharmacy records clinical support tool 
      was implemented to assist pharmacy staff in managing herpes zoster vaccine dose
      completion. METHODS: Beginning in November 2018, a large community pharmacy chain
      (operating in 36 states) implemented a provider nudge within its clinical
      decision support tool across all locations that fit seamlessly into the existing 
      workflow, alerting the pharmacy staff of the need for a patient's second dose.
      Initial and second doses were followed over 2 overlapping, 10-month periods
      before and after system launch. Differences in vaccine completion rates before
      and after the system was operational were assessed by chi-square tests and
      predictors of completion, controlling for store- and patient-level
      characteristics, and were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression and
      generalized linear models throughout 2021. RESULTS: Across 2,271 pharmacies,
      71,459 and 41,982 initial doses of the herpes zoster vaccine were given in the
      baseline and intervention period, respectively. The proportion of patients
      completing both doses increased slightly after system implementation (before:
      71.9%, after: 75.2%; p<0.0001). However, dramatic improvements in time to dose
      completion were observed (before: 109.8 days, after: 93.3 days; p<0.001), and
      changes were significant in stores in all but 4 states. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      suggest that the use of a clinical nudge improved the occurrence of and time to
      herpes zoster vaccine dose completion in adults across the U.S.

LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000001045 [doi]
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a debilitating symptom reported by patients presenting with
      postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Efforts to alleviate this pain have been projected 
      to lie in individualization of pharmacological treatment through pain phenotyping
      and subsequent investigations into the genetic basis of PHN therapy.
      Understanding the various mechanisms related to these phenotypes can aid in
      improvement of available treatment options and discovery of new ones. Knowledge
      and application of genetic variations in PHN, structural proteins, and genes can 
      aid in ascertaining risk, susceptibility to, severity of, and protection from
      PHN. This review summarizes the most recent information that has been published
      on phenotypes and genotypes with possible clinical applications and directions
      for future research.

LID - V11210869 [pii]
AB  - Neonatal herpes simplex disease (HSV) is a rare but life-threatening infection
      associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies indicate
      that the incidence rate has continued to rise over the past decades, while the
      mortality remains unchanged. Early clinical suspicion of HSV and parenteral
      antiviral treatment of acute disease is essential for the prognosis. The
      subsequent use of suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir has further enhanced
      the long-term prognosis. This review presents evidence of risk factors, clinical 
      presentation, prevention, and management of HSV in newborns.

PG  - 104549
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104549 [doi]
AB  - We report robust SARS-CoV2 neutralizing sdAbs targeting the viral peptides
      encompassing the polybasic cleavage site (CSP) and in the receptor binding domain
      (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Both the sdAbs inhibited infectivity of the CoV2 
      S protein expressing pseudoviruses (LV-CoV2S). Both anti-CSP and RBD intrabodies 
      (IB) inhibited the output of LV(CoV2 S). Anti-CSP IB altered the proteolytic
      processing and targeted the viral S protein for degradation. Because of
      cross-reactive CSPs in the entry mediators, the anti-CSP sdAb neutralized in
      vitro and in vivo the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 unrelated viruses such as herpes
      simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and pestes des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Conversely, 
      anti-HSV1 and anti-PPRV sera neutralized LV(CoV2 S) owing to the presence of CSP 
      reactive antibodies indicating that a prior infection with such pathogens could
      impact on the pattern of COVID-19.

TI  - Comparative Safety of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines in a Nationwide Cohort of
      US Veterans.
PG  - 739-746

AB  - Importance: The risk of adverse events has been found to be low for participants 
      receiving the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna Inc) vaccines in 
      randomized trials. However, a head-to-head comparison of their safety for a
      broader range of potential adverse events over longer follow-up and in larger and
      more diverse populations is lacking, to our knowledge. Objective: To compare the 
      head-to-head safety in terms of risk of adverse events of the BNT162b2 and
      mRNA-1273 vaccines in the national health care databases of the US Department of 
      Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated health care system in the US. Design,
      Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, the electronic health records of
      US veterans who received a first dose of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine
      between January 4 and September 20, 2021, were used. Recipients of each vaccine
      were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to their risk factors. Exposures:
      Vaccination with either the BNT162b2 vaccine, with a second dose scheduled 21
      days later, or the mRNA-1273 vaccine, with a second dose scheduled 28 days later.
      Main Outcomes and Measures: A large panel of potential adverse events was
      evaluated; the panel included neurologic events, hematologic events, hemorrhagic 
      stroke, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, other thromboembolic events,
      myocarditis or pericarditis, arrhythmia, kidney injury, appendicitis, autoimmune 
      events, herpes zoster or simplex, arthritis or arthropathy, and pneumonia. Risks 
      over 38 weeks were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Results: Among
      433672 persons included in the matched vaccine groups, the median age was 69
      years (IQR, 60-74 years), 93% of individuals were male, and 20% were Black.
      Estimated 38-week risks of adverse events were generally low after administration
      of either the BNT162b2 or the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Compared with the mRNA-1273
      group, the BNT162b2 group had an excess per 10000 persons of 10.9 events (95% CI,
      1.9-17.4 events) of ischemic stroke, 14.8 events (95% CI, 7.9-21.8 events) of
      myocardial infarction, 11.3 events (95% CI, 3.4-17.7 events) of other
      thromboembolic events, and 17.1 events (95% CI, 8.8-30.2 events) of kidney
      injury. Estimates were largely similar among subgroups defined by age (<40,
      40-69, and >/=70 years) and race (Black, White), but there were higher magnitudes
      of risk differences of ischemic stroke among older persons and White persons,
      kidney injury among older persons, and other thromboembolic events among Black
      persons. Small-magnitude differences between the 2 vaccines were seen within 42
      days of the first dose, and few differences were seen within 14 days of the first
      dose. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that
      there were few differences in risk of adverse events within 14 days of the first 
      dose of either the BNT162b2 or the mRNA-1273 vaccine and small-magnitude
      differences within 42 days of the first dose. The 38-week risks of adverse events
      were low in both vaccine groups, although risks were lower for recipients of the 
      mRNA-1273 vaccine than for recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Although the
      primary analysis was designed to detect safety events unrelated to SARS-CoV-2
      infection, the possibility that these differences may partially be explained by a
      lower effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing the sequelae of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the mRNA-1273 vaccine could not be ruled out. 
      These findings may help inform decision-making in future vaccination campaigns.

PG  - 268
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03461-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to provide 12-year nationwide epidemiology data to
      investigate the epidemiology and comorbidities of and therapeutic options for
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) by analyzing the National Health Insurance
      Research Database. METHODS: 6306 patients identified as having CFS during the
      2000-2012 period and 6306 controls (with similar distributions of age and sex)
      were analyzed. RESULT: The patients with CFS were predominantly female and aged
      35-64 years in Taiwan and presented a higher proportion of depression, anxiety
      disorder, insomnia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, renal disease, type 2
      diabetes, gout, dyslipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, and herpes 
      zoster. The use of selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), Serotonin antagonist and reuptake
      inhibitors (SARIs), Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), benzodiazepine (BZD),
      Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), muscle relaxants, analgesic 
      drugs, psychotherapies, and exercise therapies was prescribed significantly more 
      frequently in the CFS cohort than in the control group. CONCLUSION: This large
      national study shared the mainstream therapies of CFS in Taiwan, we noticed these
      treatments reported effective to relieve symptoms in previous studies.
      Furthermore, our findings indicate that clinicians should have a heightened
      awareness of the comorbidities of CFS, especially in psychiatric problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Letermovir (LMV) is a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) terminase
      inhibitor indicated as prophylaxis for HCMV-positive stem-cell recipients. Its
      mechanism of action involves at least the viral terminase proteins pUL56, pUL89
      and pUL51. Despite its efficiency, resistance mutations were characterized in
      vitro and in vivo, largely focused on pUL56. To date, mutations in pUL51 in
      clinical resistance remain to be demonstrated. METHODS: The pUL51 natural
      polymorphism was described by sequencing 54 LMV-naive strains and was compared to
      UL51 HCMV genes from 16 patients non-responding to LMV therapy (prophylaxis or
      curative). Recombinant viruses were built by <<en-passant>> mutagenesis to
      measure the impact of the new mutations on antiviral activity and viral growth.
      Structure prediction was performed by homology modeling. The pUL51 final-model
      was analyzed and aligned with the atomic coordinates of the monomeric HSV-1
      terminase complex (PDB:6M5R). RESULTS: Among the 16 strains from treated-patients
      with LMV, 4 never described substitutions in pUL51 (D12E, 17del, A95V, V113L)
      were highlighted. These substitutions had no impact on viral fitness. Only
      UL51-A95V conferred 13.8-fold increased LMV resistance level by itself (IC50 =
      29.246 +/- 0.788). CONCLUSION: As an isolated mutation in pUL51 in a clinical
      isolate can lead to LMV resistance, genotyping for resistance should involve
      sequencing of the pUL51, pUL56 and pUL89 genes. With terminase modelling, we make
      the hypothesis that LMV could bind to domains were UL56-L257I and UL51-A95V
      mutations were localized.

      real-world study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cladribine is a synthetic deoxyadenosine analogue approved for the
      treatment of highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Cladribine is
      considered to be a semi-selective immune-reconstitution therapy (IRT) that
      induces long-term remission following short course of treatment. Here, we
      evaluated the effect of cladribine on immune cell reduction and reconstitution
      during the first two years of treatment. METHODS: We analyzed our longitudinal,
      prospective, real-world cohort of 80 cladribine-treated RMS patients from two
      tertiary centers in Germany. Laboratory testing was conducted monthly and
      included evaluation of cellular as well as soluble parameters. Laboratory
      outcomes were correlated with infectious adverse events (AEs) and clinical or
      paraclinical disease activity. RESULTS: Selective alterations in immune cell
      populations occurred following cladribine treatment, with the most marked effects
      observed in year two of treatment. Specifically, a rapid reduction in CD56(+)
      natural killer cells (nadir: month 1 (year 1) and 14 (year 2); -37 and -41% from 
      baseline) was followed by a greater reduction in CD19(+) B cells (nadir: month 2 
      and 14; -81 and -82%); a moderate effect on CD4(+) (nadir: month 3 and 15; -48
      and -61%) and CD8(+) T cells (nadir: month 5 and 18; -40 and -48%). Despite the
      marked effect on B cells, immunoglobulin levels were unaffected. There was no or 
      minimal effect on thrombocytes and innate immune cells. Clinical and paraclinical
      disease activity was unrelated to the observed immune alterations. Lymphopenia
      was the most commonly observed AE (86.3% of patients; grade III-IV lymphopenia:
      38.8%). The cumulative incidence of infections was 55% with cladribine treatment,
      which were mostly mild or moderate. In total, 19 herpes infections developed in 8
      (10%) cladribine-treated patients; all cases were dermatomal and 94.7% of the
      herpetic infections occurred during a period of lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The
      immunophenotyping data obtained in our real-world setting are comparable to those
      demonstrated in pivotal clinical trials and provide further evidence that
      cladribine may represent a form of IRT. However, regarding the side-effect
      profile of cladribine, severe lymphopenia (exceeding grade II CTCAE) was more
      frequent, which may have prompted the development of herpes infections. Of note, 
      lymphocyte dynamics did not correlate with clinical and paraclinical measures of 
      disease activity in the two-year follow-up period.

TI  - Oncolytic virus expressing PD-1 inhibitors activates a collaborative intratumoral
      immune response to control tumor and synergizes with CTLA-4 or TIM-3 blockade.
LID - e004762 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are capable to inflame the tumor
      microenvironment (TME) and elicit infiltrating tumor-specific T cell responses.
      However, OV treatment negatively alters the cancer-immune set point in tumors to 
      attenuate the antitumor immune response, which suggests the necessity of
      dissecting the immune landscape of the virus-treated tumors and developing novel 
      strategies to maximize the potential of OVs. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effect of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-armed OVs
      targeting PD-1 on the TME, and ultimately overcome localized immunosuppression to
      sensitize tumors to immunotherapies. METHODS: A tumor-selective oncolytic herpes 
      simplex virus vector was engineered to encode a humanized scFv against human PD-1
      (hPD-1scFv) (YST-OVH). The antitumor efficacy of YST-OVH was explored in multiple
      therapeutic mouse models. The neurotoxicity and safety of YST-OVH were evaluated 
      in nonhuman primates. The precise dynamics in the TME involved in YST-OVH
      treatment were dissected using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF). RESULTS: The 
      identified hPD-1scFv showed superior T-cell activating activity. Localized
      delivery of hPD-1scFv by YST-OVH promotes systemic antitumor immunity in
      humanized PD-1 mouse models of established cancer. Immune profiling of tumors
      using CyTOF revealed the enhanced antitumor effect of YST-OVH, which largely
      relied on CD8(+) T cell activity by augmenting the tumor infiltration of effector
      CD8(+) T cells and establishment of memory CD8(+) T cells and reducing associated
      CD8(+) T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, YST-OVH treatment modified the
      cancer-immune set point of tumors coupled to coexpression of CTLA-4 and TIM-3 on 
      exhausted CD8(+) T cells and high levels of CTLA-4(+) Treg cells. A combination
      approach incorporating anti-CTLA-4 or anti-TIM-3 further improved efficacy by
      increasing tumor immunogenicity and activating antitumor adaptive immune
      responses. Moreover, this therapeutic strategy showed no neurotoxicity and was
      well tolerated in nonhuman primates. The benefit of intratumoral hPD-1scFv
      expression was also observed in humanized mice bearing human cancer cells.
      CONCLUSION: Localized delivery of PD-1 inhibitors by engineered YST-OVH was a
      highly effective and safe strategy for cancer immunotherapy. YST-OVH also
      synergized with CTLA-4 or TIM-3 blockade to enhance the immune response to
      cancer. These data provide a strong rationale for further clinical evaluation of 
      this novel therapeutic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We enhanced surveillance of hospitalizations of all ages for acute
      encephalitis syndrome (AES) along with infectious aetiologies, including the
      Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). METHODS: From October 2018 to September 2020, 
      we screened neurological patients for AES in all age groups in Maharashtra and
      Telangana States. AES cases were enrolled at study hospitals along with other
      referrals and sampled with cerebrospinal fluid, acute and convalescent sera. We
      tested specimens for non-viral aetiologies viz. leptospirosis, typhoid, scrub
      typhus, malaria and acute bacterial meningitis, along with viruses - JEV, Dengue 
      virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Chandipura virus (CHPV) and Herpes
      simplex virus (HSV). RESULTS: Among 4977 neurological hospitalizations at three
      study site hospitals over two years period, 857 (17.2%) were AES. However, only
      287 (33.5%) AES cases were eligible. Among 278 (96.9%) enrolled AES cases,
      infectious aetiologies were identified in 115 (41.4%) cases, including non-viral 
      in 17 (6.1%) cases - leptospirosis (8), scrub-typhus (3) and typhoid (6); and
      viral in 98 (35.3%) cases - JEV (58, 20.9%), HSV (22, 7.9%), DENV (15, 5.4%) and 
      CHPV (3, 1.1%). JEV confirmation was significantly higher in enrolled cases than 
      referred cases (10.2%) (p < 0.05). However, the contribution of JEV in AES cases 
      was similar in both children and adults. JE was reported year-round and from
      adjacent non-endemic districts. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese encephalitis virus
      continues to be the leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in central India
      despite vaccination among children. Surveillance needs to be strengthened along
      with advanced diagnostic testing for assessing the impact of vaccination.

TI  - Infectious esophagitis in children.
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003523 [doi]
AB  - Infectious esophagitis is the third most common cause of esophagitis after
      gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) 1 and should
      always be considered in the differential of patients with dysphagia and
      odynophagia. The most common organisms causing disease are candida, Herpes
      simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is well recognised that an
      impaired local or systemic immune system is a risk factor for disease, however
      esophageal dysmotility and disruptions in esophageal homeostasis and the
      esophageal milieu are likely to represent additional risk factors in disease
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Herpes zoster prophylaxis with low-dose acyclovir in patients with malignant
      lymphoma and multiple myeloma treated with autologous stem cell transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ejh.13810 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a frequent complication after autologous stem
      cell transplantation (ASCT). The option of zoster prophylaxis with an antiviral
      drug is described in the literature, but there is no consensus on the drug and
      the dosage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of 310 patients treated
      with ASCT who were controlled regularly regarding HZ inter alia for at least 24
      months following ASCT. Since 01/2015 patients received prophylactic low-dose
      acyclovir (400 mg per day) during the first 12 months following discharge after
      ASCT (n = 107). RESULTS: Twenty percent of patients without this kind of
      prophylaxis and 2.8% of patients with prophylaxis developed HZ (p < .001). No
      patient with this prophylaxis developed HZ in the first year after ASCT, 2.8% of 
      patients in the second year after ASCT. A prognostic factor was the kind of
      diagnosis: 30% of lymphoma patients and 14% of myeloma patients developed HZ in
      the first 24 months after ASCT without prophylaxis, but only 6.3% and 0% of
      patients with prophylaxis, respectively. Neither an increase of HZ cases
      following prophylaxis nor acyclovir refractory HZ cases were observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Zoster prophylaxis with low-dose acyclovir over 12 months after ASCT
      is effective and well tolerated.

      Difficulties.
PG  - e24805
LID - 10.7759/cureus.24805 [doi]
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare complication of herpes zoster. Because of its
      rarity, it may be overlooked in the differential diagnosis of patients with
      bacterial superinfection on herpes zoster lesions. We present the case of a
      59-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus receiving oral antibiotic therapy with
      the diagnosis of bacterial superinfection due to herpes zoster involving the
      C7-T8 dermatomes bilaterally. She presented at our emergency department with a
      deteriorated general condition and signs of sepsis. Her Laboratory Risk Indicator
      for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score was 10. Necrotizing fasciitis can arise 
      from herpes zoster lesions. However, its rarity can lead to delayed treatment
      which can further result in significant morbidity, and even mortality, and should
      be considered among patients presenting with bacterial superinfections. The
      LRINEC score is very effective and practical for differentiating necrotizing
      fasciitis from bacterial superinfections. In case of suspicion, follow-up must be
      conducted on an inpatient basis.

PG  - 161-163
LID - 10.29399/npa.27507 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
      (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis are associated entities. On the contrary, although both
      are autoimmune diseases, the association of neuromyelitis optica spectrum
      disorder (NMOSD) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis is not well explained. Herein, we
      present consecutively developed post-herpetic anti-NMDAR encephalitis in a
      patient with the coexistence of NMOSD and Sjogren syndrome. In our patient
      evaluation with MRI and clinical findings, the diagnosis of HSE after
      immunosuppressive drug application for NMOSD was made. Whereupon, HSE triggered
      NMDAR encephalitis. Many authors demonstrated the induction of anti-NMDAR
      encephalitis over herpes encephalitis with the presence of movement disorders,
      psychiatric manifestations, and cognitive dysfunction. In our patient, without
      biphasic disease activity; the persistence of symptoms, new MRI findings, and the
      positivity of anti-NMDAR antibody confirmed the anti-NMDAR encephalitis
      diagnosis. Our patient is a representative case mentioning the importance of
      close follow-up of a patient in neuroimmunology.

TI  - Nanoemulsions of Jasminum humile L. and Jasminum grandiflorum L. Essential Oils: 
      An Approach to Enhance Their Cytotoxic and Antiviral Effects.
LID - 3639 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27113639 [doi]
AB  - Unprecedented nanoemulsion formulations (NE) of Jasminum humile and Jasminum
      grandiflorum essential oils (EO) were prepared, and examined for their cytotoxic 
      and antiviral activities. NE characterization and stability examination tests
      were performed to ensure formula stability. The antiviral activity was determined
      against hepatitis A (HAV) and herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) viruses using MTT
      assay, while the cytotoxic potential was determined against liver (HepG-2),
      breast (MCF-7), leukemia (THP-1) cancer cell lines and normal Vero cells.
      Statistical significance was determined in comparison with doxorubicin as
      cytotoxic and acyclovir as antiviral standard drugs. GC-MS analysis indicated
      twenty four compounds in the EO of J. humile and seventeen compounds in the EO of
      J. grandiflorum. Biological investigations of pure EOs revealed weak cytotoxic
      and antiviral effects. Nevertheless, their NE formulations exhibited high
      biological value as cytotoxic and antiviral agents. NE formulations also showed
      feasible selectivity index for the viral-infected and cancer cells (especially
      HepG-2) than normal Vero cells. Both nanoemulsions showed lower IC50 than
      standard doxorubicin against HepG-2 (26.65 and 22.58 vs. 33.96 mug/mL) and MCF-7 
      (36.09 and 36.19 vs. 52.73 mug/mL), respectively. The study results showed the
      dramatic effect of nanoemulsion preparation on the biological activity of EOs and
      other liposoluble phytopharmaceuticals.

      HSV-1 and HAdV-5.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27113552 [doi]
AB  - The core of Cyclolinopeptide A (CLA, cyclo(LIILVPPFF)), responsible for its high 
      immunosuppressive activity, contains a Pro-Pro-Phe-Phe sequence. A newly
      synthesized cyclic tetrapeptide, cyclo(Pro-Pro-beta(3)-HoPhe-Phe) (denoted as
      4B8M) bearing the active sequence of CLA, was recently shown to exhibit a wide
      array of anti-inflammatory properties in mouse models. In this investigation, we 
      demonstrate that the peptide significantly inhibits the replication of human
      adenovirus C serotype 5 (HAdV-5) and Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) in
      epithelial lung cell line A-549, applying Cidofovir and Acyclovir as reference
      drugs. Based on a previously established mechanism of its action, we propose that
      the peptide may inhibit virus replication by the induction of PGE2 acting via
      EP2/EP4 receptors in epithelial cells. In summary, we reveal a new, antiviral
      property of this anti-inflammatory peptide.

TI  - Antiviral Activities of Officinaloside C against Herpes Simplex Virus-1.
LID - 3365 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27113365 [doi]
AB  - The iridoid compounds in traditional Chinese medicine play a prominent role in
      their antiviral effects. We previously reported the anti-inflammatory effect of
      new iridoids from the aerial parts of Morinda officinalis. Nevertheless, several 
      open questions remain to explore the other biological functions of these new
      iridoid compounds. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is one of the most prevalent
      pathogens in human beings worldwide and due to limited therapies, mainly with the
      guanosine analog aciclovir (ACV) and other analogs, the search for new drugs with
      different modes of action and low toxicity becomes particularly urgent for public
      health. This study aimed to explore the anti-HSV-1 effects of iridoids from the
      aerial parts of Morinda officinalis. The dried aerial parts of Morinda
      officinalis were extracted with 95% ethanol and systematic separation and
      purification were then carried out by modern column chromatography methods such
      as silica gel column, RP-ODS column, Sephadex LH-20 gel column, and
      semi-preparative liquid phase, and the structure of these compounds were
      identified through the physical and chemical properties and a variety of spectral
      techniques. The obtained seven new iridoid compounds were screened for antiviral 
      activity on HSV-1 through CCK8 and the cytopathic effect, and then the plaque
      reduction assay, the anti-fluorescence reporter virus strain replication, and
      RT-qPCR experiments were carried out to further evaluate the antiviral effect.
      Seven new iridoid compounds (officinaloside A-G) were identified from the aerial 
      parts of Morinda officinalis, and officinaloside C showed anti-HSV-1 activity.
      Further functional experiments confirmed that officinaloside C has a significant 
      inhibiting effect on HSV-1 virus plaque formation, viral gene, and protein
      expression, and fluorescent virus replication. Our findings suggest that
      officinaloside C has significant inhibitory effects on viral plaque formation,
      genome replication, and viral protein expression of HSV-1 which implies that
      officinaloside C exhibits viral activity and may be a promising treatment for
      HSV-1 infection.

TI  - Cerebral Organoids for Modeling of HSV-1-Induced-Amyloid beta Associated
      Neuropathology and Phenotypic Rescue.
LID - 5981 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23115981 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection is a potential risk factor involved
      in the Amyloid beta (Abeta) associated neuropathology. However, further
      understanding of the neuropathological effects of the HSV-1 infection is hampered
      by the limitations of existing infection models due to the distinct differences
      between human brains and other mammalians' brains. Here we generated cerebral
      organoid models derived from pluripotent stem cells to investigate the
      HSV-induced Abeta associated neuropathology and the role of antiviral drugs in
      the phenotypic rescue. Our results identified that the HSV-1-infected cerebral
      organoids recapitulated Abeta associated neuropathology including the
      multicellular Abeta deposition, dysregulated endogenous AD mediators, reactive
      gliosis, neuroinflammation, and neural loss, indicating that cerebral organoids
      offer an opportunity for modeling the interaction of HSV-1 with the complex
      phenotypes across the genetic, cellular, and tissue levels of the human
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we identified that two antiviral drugs,
      namely Ribavirin (RBV) and Valacyclovir (VCV), inhibited HSV-1 replication and
      rescued the neuropathological phenotypes associated with AD in the HSV-1-infected
      cerebral organoids, implying their therapeutic potential to slow down the
      progression of AD. Our study provides a high-fidelity human-relevant in-vitro
      HSV-1 infection model to reconstitute the multiscale neuropathological features
      associated with AD and discover therapeutic drug candidates relevant to the AD
      viral hypothesis.

TI  - Diagnostic Utility of Bronchoalveolar Lavage in Patients with Acute Leukemia
      under Broad-Spectrum Anti-Infective Treatment.
LID - 2773 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14112773 [doi]
AB  - Despite therapeutic advances in the prevention and treatment of febrile
      neutropenia, acute leukemia (AL) patients still have considerable febrile
      neutropenia-related mortality. However, the diagnostic yield of flexible
      bronchoscopy (FB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in acute leukemia patients is 
      unclear. In this retrospective single-center study, we analyzed 88 BAL samples of
      patients with acute leukemia and pulmonary infiltrates in spite of treatment with
      broad-spectrum anti-infective agents. The aim was to investigate the impact of FB
      with BAL on detecting causative organisms, which would result in a change in
      treatment regimens. The median age was 59 years, and 86% had acute myeloid
      leukemia. In 47%, pathogens were detectable in BAL fluid (pathogen bacteria,
      viruses, and fungi in 2, 15, and 18%, respectively), with Aspergillus fumigatus
      detected most frequently. BAL-guided anti-infective therapy changes were
      performed in 15%. The detection of herpes simplex and influenza viruses were the 
      main reasons for treatment changes. Despite broad-spectrum anti-infective
      treatment, in approximately half of all patients, pathogens could still be
      isolated in BAL samples. However, consecutive changes in anti-infective treatment
      were considerably less frequent, with most changes performed in patients with
      Herpes simplex virus and Influenza A detection. The need for FB with BAL in
      patients with AL receiving broad-spectrum empiric anti-infective treatment should
      therefore be weighed carefully.

TI  - Efficacy of Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus T-VEC Combined with BET Inhibitors as 
      an Innovative Therapy Approach for NUT Carcinoma.
LID - 2761 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14112761 [doi]
AB  - NUT carcinoma (NC) is an extremely aggressive tumor and current treatment
      regimens offer patients a median survival of six months only. This article
      reports on the first in vitro studies using immunovirotherapy as a promising
      therapy option for NC and its feasible combination with BET inhibitors (iBET).
      Using NC cell lines harboring the BRD4-NUT fusion protein, the cytotoxicity of
      oncolytic virus talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) and the iBET compounds BI894999 
      and GSK525762 were assessed in vitro in monotherapeutic and combinatorial
      approaches. Viral replication, marker gene expression, cell proliferation, and
      IFN-beta dependence of T-VEC efficiency were monitored. T-VEC efficiently
      infected and replicated in NC cell lines and showed strong cytotoxic effects.
      This implication could be enhanced by iBET treatment following viral infection.
      Viral replication was not impaired by iBET treatment. In addition, it was shown
      that pretreatment of NC cells with IFN-beta does impede the replication as well
      as the cytotoxicity of T-VEC. T-VEC was found to show great potential for
      patients suffering from NC. Of note, when applied in combination with iBETs, a
      reinforcing influence was observed, leading to an even stronger anti-tumor
      effect. These findings suggest combining virotherapy with diverse molecular
      therapeutics for the treatment of NC.

AB  - Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for chronic pain. VZV injection has
      similarities to herpes zoster (HZ) "shingles" pain in humans. In this study
      orofacial pain was induced by injecting male rats with the human VZV. The
      amygdala and parabrachial have been implicated to control affective/motivational 
      orofacial pain. Recently our lab reported neurexin 3alpha (Nrxn3alpha) is
      expressed in the central amygdala and parabrachial. GABAergic neurons descend
      from the central amygdala to the lateral parabrachial region and Nrxn3alpha is
      important for presynaptic (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) GABA release. Thus, we
      hypothesized that lateral parabrachial neuronal activity and orofacial pain are
      controlled by Nrxn3alpha within the central amygdala. To test the hypothesis
      Nrxn3alpha expression was knocked down (i.e., using short hairpin RNA or shRNA)
      in the central amygdala and GABA release and neuronal activity were quantitated
      in the parabrachial concomitant with measurement of the VZV induced pain
      response. Results revealed that attenuating Nrxn3 expression within the amygdala 
      reduces GABA release in the parabrachial and increases neuronal activity within
      the lateral parabrachial region. Attenuating Nrxn3 expression also increases VZV 
      associated orofacial pain. Activating GABAergic neurons within the central
      amygdala with opsins increase GABA release in the parabrachial and reduced the
      pain response after Nrxn3 shRNA treatment. These results are consistent with the 
      idea that Nrxn3 within the central amygdala controls VZV associated pain by
      regulating GABA release in the lateral parabrachial that then controls the
      activity of ascending pain neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      mimic those associated with human herpesvirus (HHV) infection. In this study, we 
      estimated the prevalence of herpesvirus in patients with COVID-19 and determined 
      if coinfection is associated with poorer outcomes and neurological symptoms.
      METHODS: We analyzed samples of 53 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The samples 
      were evaluated for the presence of alphaherpesviruses, betaherpesviruses, and
      gammaherpesviruses, and the viral loads were quantified using quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. RESULTS: Among the patients, in 79.2%
      had detection at least one type of herpesvirus. HHV-6 (47.2%), cytomegalovirus
      (43.3%), and HHV-7 (39.6%) showed the highest detection rates. Patients with a
      high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) load were more 
      likely to show herpes simplex virus 1 detection (p = 0.037). Among patients
      coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and HHVs, 26.4% showed central nervous
      system-associated neurological symptoms and herpetic manifestations. A
      statistically significant association was observed between neurological changes
      and HHV-6 detection (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed a high
      prevalence of herpesvirus in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, even though
      SARS-CoV-2 and HHV coinfection was not associated with poorer outcomes, the
      findings demonstrated the association between neurological symptoms and HHV-6
      detection.

AB  - Wolf's isotopic phenomenon occurs when a new dermatosis appears on a site that
      has already healed from a previous dermatological disease of another etiology.
      This report describes the case of a 44-year-old female patient undergoing
      treatment for breast carcinoma who recently had brownish erythematous lesions
      appearing on the scar region of previous herpes zoster on the right hemithorax.
      Histopathology and immunohistochemistry examination confirmed skin metastasis of 
      breast cancer. Herpes zoster scars require attention due to the possibility of an
      isotopic response as a facilitating factor in some dermatoses, sometimes severe
      ones, such as neoplasms.

TI  - Incident Herpes Zoster and Risk of Dementia: A Population-Based Danish Cohort
      Study.
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200709 [pii]
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200709 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the
      neurotrophic varicella-zoster virus. Zoster may contribute to development of
      dementia through neuroinflammation, cerebral vasculopathy, or direct neural
      damage, but epidemiological evidence is limited. We used data from linked
      nationwide Danish registries to conduct a cohort study of the association between
      zoster and dementia during 1997 to 2017. As secondary aims, we examined if
      associations were more pronounced for zoster involving cranial nerves (mainly
      ophthalmic zoster) or the central nervous system and Alzheimer's disease as an
      outcome. METHODS: We included people aged >/=40 years with zoster and a general
      population comparison cohort matched 5:1 by sex and birth year. We identified
      zoster and dementia in the registries using prescription records in the community
      and hospital diagnoses. We used Cox regression to compute confounder-adjusted
      hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia associated
      with zoster during 0-1 year and 1-21 years of follow-up. We compared the
      cumulative incidence of dementia, inverse probability-weighted for confounders.
      RESULTS: The study included 247,305 people with zoster and 1,235,890 matched
      general population comparators (median age 64 years; 61% female). The HR of
      all-cause dementia was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.04) during the first year and 0.93
      (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) thereafter in people with zoster versus matched comparators. 
      Dementia was diagnosed in 9.7% of zoster patients and 10.3% of matched
      comparators by end of follow-up. We observed no increased long-term risk of
      dementia in subgroup analyses, except possibly in people with central nervous
      system infection (HR 1.94; 95% CI: 0.78-4.80). Analyses of Alzheimer's disease as
      a separate outcome showed similar results. DISCUSSION: Herpes zoster is not
      associated with increased risk of dementia, and contrary to expectation we found 
      a small decrease in risk. The explanation for this finding is unclear, and
      systematic errors should be considered. Patients with central nervous system
      involvement had almost two-fold increased relative risk of dementia. The
      population attributable fraction of dementia due to this rare complication is
      estimated at 0.014%. Therefore, universal vaccination against varicella-zoster
      virus in the elderly is unlikely to reduce dementia risk.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.9334-22 [doi]
AB  - A 73-year-old Japanese man with diabetic complications presented with involuntary
      lip movements and long-lasting hiccups after developing zoster rash. Magnetic
      resonance imaging revealed lesions involving the medial temporal lobe and C1
      level of the spinal cord. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalomyelitis was
      diagnosed. We considered attributing the orofacial dyskinesia, a very rare
      symptom of VZV central nervous system (CNS) complications, to the temporal lobe
      lesion. Although the culprit lesion for the hiccups was unclear, further
      examinations may have clarified this issue. As immunocompromised patients with
      herpes zoster may develop CNS complications with a wide variety of symptoms,
      special care is needed.

PG  - 722-733
LID - 10.1007/s12328-022-01640-6 [doi]
AB  - Granulomas consist of focal collections of immune cells that forms as a result of
      chronic inflammation. They can be formed in different organs and are considered
      the hallmark for several inflammatory and infectious diseases. The presence of
      granulomas in the mucosal biopsies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of
      immunocompetent patients, along with histological features of chronicity,
      confirms the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) in the majority of cases. However,
      owing to their immunocompromised state, new-onset inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) is rare in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In
      these patients, diarrhea is often due to the presence of an opportunistic
      infection, including bacteria (Salmonella, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)),
      protozoa (Cryptosporidia, Giardia), viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex
      virus) or fungi (Histoplasma). Infection by MAC is prevalent in patients with
      AIDS, but isolated involvement of GI tract by this organism is rare. Positive
      Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) stain and culture on mucosal biopsy usually establish
      the diagnosis. We report an unusual case of isolated MAC colitis that was
      originally misdiagnosed as CD. The AFB stain and culture were negative,
      indicating the importance of having a high suspicion for infectious etiologies
      when clinically indicated.

TI  - Detection and quantification of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human
      herpesvirus-6 in stomach frozen tissue of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer
      patients.
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.13013 [doi]
AB  - Human herpes viruses (HHVs) are among the most common infectious agents detected 
      in the gastrointestinal tract that might be involved in oncogenesis and other
      gastrointestinal disorders. Although the link between the Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) and gastric cancer (GC) has been established, the role of the viruses in
      various stomach diseases remains unknown. The frequencies and viral copy number
      of EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) among 50 gastric
      cancer tumors and 105 chronic gastritis tissues were measured by quantitative
      real-time PCR. In the tumor specimens and the adjacent normal tissues EBV was
      found in 60% and 30.9%, CMV in 14% and 4.7%, and HHV-6 in 18%, and 14.2%,
      respectively. The detection rate of EBV and CMV was found to be significantly
      higher in tumor tissues relative to the adjacent normal tissues. Also, in chronic
      gastritis, the frequency of EBV, CMV, and HHV-6 was 19%, 12.3%, and 15.2%,
      respectively, compared with 16.4%, 1.1%, and 8.2% in their corresponding normal
      tissues. Here, the CMV frequency was found to be significantly higher in
      gastritis tissues relative to the adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, viral
      load in both gastric cancer and gastritis groups was higher in either tumor or
      gastritis lesion compared with matched adjacent normal tissue. This study showed 
      a clear association between gastric cancer with both EBV and CMV. Meanwhile,
      analyses revealed a strong association between the EBV, CMV, and HHV-6 viral
      loads with gastritis (P = 0.0026, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0405, respectively). Our 
      results suggest that these three viruses might contribute to the induction and
      development the gastritis and gastric cancer.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multifactorial autoimmune disease
      depending on both intrinsic and environmental factors. Among the latter, the
      Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has long been suggested as one of the responsible
      factors for the onset and activity of lupus disease. It is a herpes virus with a 
      very specific tropism for B lymphocytes and therefore closely linked to the
      immune system. EBV infection almost always precedes the onset of lupus disease
      and in vitro data and animal models suggest that anti-EBV response may favor the 
      development of autoantibodies and lupus disease in some subjects. Also, there are
      abnormalities in humoral and cellular responses to EBV and lupus patients have
      impaired control of EBV, with higher blood viral loads. Interstingly, this virus 
      seems to be able to promote disease activity, by promoting the survival of
      autoreactive B lymphocytes and the production of interferon-alpha, which are two 
      pivotal mechanisms in the pathophysiology of lupus disease.

AB  - Latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) may be reactivated to cause herpes zoster,
      which affects one in three people during their lifetime. The currently available 
      subunit vaccine Shingrix is superior to the attenuated vaccine Zostavax(R) in
      terms of both safety and efficacy, but the supply of its key adjuvant component
      QS21 is limited. With ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that were recently
      approved by the FDA for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as carriers, and
      oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODNs) approved by the FDA for a 
      subunit hepatitis B vaccine as immunostimulators, we developed a LNP vaccine
      encapsulating VZV-glycoprotein E (gE) and CpG ODN, and compared its
      immunogenicity with Shingrix in C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that the LNP
      vaccine induced comparable levels of gE-specific IgG antibodies to Shingrix as
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Most importantly, the
      LNP vaccine induced comparable levels of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) that plays 
      decisive roles in the efficacy of zoster vaccines to Shingrix in a VZV-primed
      mouse model that was adopted for preclinical studies of Shingrix. Number of IL-2 
      and IFN-gamma secreting splenocytes and proportion of T helper 1 (Th1)
      cytokine-expressing CD4(+) T cells in LNP-CpG-adjuvanted VZV-gE vaccinated mice
      were similar to that of Shingrix boosted mice. All of the components in this LNP 
      vaccine can be artificially and economically synthesized in large quantities,
      indicating the potential of LNP-CpG-adjuvanted VZV-gE as a more cost-effective
      zoster vaccine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-toxic hand hygiene and surface disinfectant products with
      virucidal activity against alcohol-resistant nonenveloped norovirus are in urgent
      need. METHOD: Alcohol-based formulations were made with
      epigallocatechin-3-gallate-palmitate (EC16), an FDA accepted food additive. Based
      on in-house testing of formulations, 3 prototypes, PTV80 hand gel, PST70 surface 
      disinfectant spray and PST70 surface disinfectant wipe, were selected from
      in-house tests for independent testing at GLP (good laboratory practice)
      laboratories according to EN 14476:2019 (hand gel), ASTM test method E1053-20
      (spray), and ASTM E2362-15, E1053, and ASTM E2896-12 (wipe). RESULTS: The PTV80
      hand gel prototype demonstrated a >99.999% reduction of murine norovirus S99
      infectivity in 60 seconds. Carrier testing of the PST70 surface spray and surface
      wipe demonstrated reduction of feline calicivirus infectivity by >99.99% in 60
      seconds. In addition, testing with human coronavirus and human herpes simplex
      virus demonstrated >99.99% efficacy in 60 seconds, consistent with broad spectrum
      virucidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The novel non-toxic prototypes containing EC16
      were found to be suitable for use in future hand sanitizer gel, surface
      disinfectant spray and wipe products against norovirus. Products based on these
      formulations could be used safely to help prevent and control norovirus and other
      emerging virus outbreaks, pending future studies.

TI  - The prevalence for the risk of serious infection in hypothermic infants </= 60
      days: A systematic review.
LID - 10.1111/acem.14547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Temperature abnormalities in infants may be a sign of a serious
      infection (SI) and there is literature regarding the workup of the febrile infant
      to help guide management. The prevalence of SIs in hypothermic infants and the
      development of established guidelines for this population has not been
      established. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of SI in
      hypothermic infants who are 60 days old or younger presenting to the emergency
      department (ED). In addition, we calculated the prevalence of SI by organ system 
      and identified its microorganism. METHODS: We performed a systematic review by
      searching the literature in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We
      limited our search to infants </= 60 days with a rectal temperature <36.5 degrees
      C who presented to the ED. We defined SI as bacteremia, urinary tract infection
      (UTI), meningitis, herpes simplex virus infections, or pneumonia. We calculated
      the prevalence of SI. Quality of studies and bias was assessed using QUADAS-2.
      Our study was registered with PROSPERO, 2020 CRD42020153477. RESULTS: We
      identified 1242 articles from our initial search in December 2019 followed by a
      second search in February 2021 to capture any recent publications. We identified 
      four studies meeting our inclusion criteria. We estimated the prevalence of SI as
      4.86% (95% confidence Interval [CI] 1.97-8.82) for infants </= 60 days old. In a 
      subgroup analysis of infants </= 28 days (n = 16/374), we estimated the
      prevalence of SI as 5.15 (95% CI 0.95-12.0). The most common source for SI was
      UTI, with a prevalence of 2.16% (95% CI 1.18-3.60). CONCLUSION: The overall
      prevalence of SI was 4.86% in hypothermic young infants </= 60 days old
      presenting to the ED. Infants </= 28 days had a slightly higher prevalence of
      5.15%. The most common source for serious bacterial infection was UTI.

AB  - Introduction: Whether intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM)
      and norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) have a differential impact on the incidence
      of sexually transmitted infection (STI) remains unclear. In the Vaginal and Oral 
      Interventions to Control the Epidemic (VOICE) trial, HIV-1 acquisition was higher
      for DMPA-IM users vs. NET-EN users. We compared DMPA-IM and NET-EN users with
      regard to chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex
      virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Materials and Methods: Prospective data were
      analyzed from VOICE, a randomized trial of HIV-1 chemoprophylaxis. Participants
      were evaluated annually and as indicated for chlamydia, gonorrhea,
      trichomoniasis, and syphilis. Stored specimens were tested for HSV-2.
      Proportional hazards models compared the risk of STI between DMPA-IM and NET-EN
      users. Results: Among 2,911 injectable contraception users in South Africa, 1,800
      (61.8%) used DMPA-IM and 1,111 used NET-EN (38.2%). DMPA-IM and NET-EN users did 
      not differ in baseline chlamydia: 15.1 vs. 14.3%, p= 0.54; gonorrhea: 3.4 vs.
      3.7%, p= 0.70; trichomoniasis: 5.7 vs.5.0%, p= 0.40; or syphilis: 1.5 vs. 0.7%,
      p= 0.08; but differed for baseline HSV-2: (51.3 vs. 38.6%, p < 0.001). Four
      hundred forty-eight incident chlamydia, 103 gonorrhea, 150 trichomonas, 17
      syphilis, and 48 HSV-2 infections were detected over 2,742, 2,742, 2,783, 2,945, 
      and 756 person-years (py), respectively (chlamydia 16.3/100 py; gonorrhea 3.8/100
      py; trichomoniasis 5.4/100 py; syphilis 0.6/100 py; HSV-2 6.4/100 py). Comparing 
      DMPA-IM with NET-EN users, no difference was noted in the incidence of chlamydia,
      gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, or HSV2 infections, including when adjusted 
      for confounders [chlamydia (aHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.25), gonorrhea (aHR 0.88, 95%
      CI 0.60-1.31), trichomoniasis (aHR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.54), syphilis (aHR 0.41,
      95% CI 0.15-1.10), and HSV-2 (aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45-1.54, p= 0.56)]. Discussion: 
      Among South African participants enrolled in VOICE, DMPA-IM and NETEN users
      differed in prevalence of HSV-2 at baseline but did not differ in the incidence
      of chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, or HSV-2 infection.
      Differential HIV-1 acquisition, previously demonstrated in this cohort, does not 
      appear to be explained by differential STI acquisition. However, the high
      incidence of multiple STIs reinforces the need to accelerate access to
      comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Update of the Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine
      in Japanese Older Adults.
PG  - 1447-1467
LID - 10.1007/s13555-022-00744-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to update cost-effectiveness and public health
      impact estimates of the two-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) compared with
      no vaccination against herpes zoster (HZ) in the Japanese population aged 65
      years. List price of the vaccine and latest RZV efficacy and waning estimates
      were incorporated. METHODS: A multicohort static Markov model with a cycle length
      of 1 year was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of one million people aged 65 
      years over their remaining lifetime (base case). Age-stratified vaccine efficacy 
      and waning rates were updated on the basis of the latest clinical trial data
      (interim ZOE-LTFU; NCT02723773). First-dose coverage was assumed at 40%, and
      second-dose compliance was assumed at 95%. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 
      2% annually, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated
      from payer and societal perspectives. The societal perspective considered
      productivity loss due to suffering HZ, or due to suffering HZ and time required
      for vaccination. Sensitivity analyses explored the overall uncertainties in the
      model. Scenario analyses for Japanese adults aged 50, 60, 70, 80, >/= 50, and >/=
      65 years (main scenario) were conducted. An ICER below yen5-6
      million/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was considered cost-effective. RESULTS:
      RZV was estimated to prevent 71,423 HZ cases and 15,858 post-herpetic neuralgia
      (PHN) cases per million people aged 65 years compared with no vaccine in Japan.
      The ICER was yen4,205,515 from a payer perspective and was most sensitive to
      assumptions regarding vaccine efficacy waning, proportion of patients with HZ
      developing PHN, and HZ incidence. From societal perspectives, ICERs were
      yen3,854,192 (productivity loss from suffering HZ only) and yen4,622,212
      (productivity loss from suffering HZ and time required for vaccination). Overall,
      the results were considered robust under extensive sensitivity and scenario
      analyses. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against HZ with RZV is cost-effective compared 
      with no vaccination in Japanese adults aged 65 years.

PG  - e936707
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.936707 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection can increase the risk of
      cerebrovascular disease, involving small and large arteries, especially in
      immunosuppressed patients with ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve
      involvement. We present the case of a patient with intracerebral VZV vasculopathy
      without overt clinical manifestation but with abnormal imaging findings in the
      brain magnetic resonance (MR). CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), without other traditional cardiovascular risk factors,
      presented to the hospital due to headache, vertical diplopia, decreased of visual
      acuity of right eye, and disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection with
      predominant skin lesions distributed along the ophthalmic division of the right
      trigeminal nerve. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed meningitis and
      positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV, and a brain MRI scan showed a
      right occipital hemorrhagic lesion; thus, she was diagnosed with disseminated VZV
      infection with neurological involvement. She received intravenous acyclovir for
      10 days. One month later, a physical examination was unremarkable and she was
      asymptomatic, but control brain MR angiography showed stenosis of the right
      internal carotid and the right middle cerebral artery, compatible with VZV
      vasculopathy. The PCR for VZV turned negative in CSF but the titers of anti-VZV
      IgG antibodies in CSF were high, and no increase of plasma autoimmune biomarkers 
      were detected at any time in the course of the clinical evolution. CONCLUSIONS
      Discordance between imaging findings and clinical manifestations can appear in
      intracerebral VZV vasculopathy. A differential diagnosis is mandatory, especially
      if there is underlying immunosuppression.

TI  - Recombinant Zoster Vaccine Uptake and Risk of Flares Among Older Adults with
      Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases in the United States.
LID - 10.1002/art.42261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Persons with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are at
      increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). In 2018, CDC recommended a highly
      efficacious vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), for prevention of HZ in
      immunocompetent >/=50 years-olds. We estimated RZV vaccination among adults age
      >/=50 years with IMIDs during 2018-2019 and examined possible vaccine-related
      flares following RZV. METHODS: We identified a cohort of IMID patients using
      medical claims data from IBM(R) MarketScan(R) (age 50-64 years) and Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare (age >/=65 years). Presumed flares were
      defined as hospitalization/emergency department visit for their respective IMIDs,
      or steroid treatment with a short-acting oral glucocorticoid or parenteral
      glucocorticoid injection. We conducted a self-controlled case series (SCCS)
      analysis to examine a temporal association between RZV and flares. RESULTS: Among
      enrollees with IMIDs, 14.8% of 55,654 MarketScan and 43.2% of 160,545 Medicare
      enrollees received >/=1-dose of RZV during 2018-2019. Two-dose series completion 
      was 76.6% in MarketScan and 85.4% in Medicare enrollees. In the SCCS analysis,
      10% and 13% developed flares in the control as compared to 9% and 11-12% in the
      risk window following 1- or 2-doses of RZV among MarketScan and Medicare
      enrollees, respectively. We found no statistically significant increase in flares
      following RZV administration for any IMID in either age group following RZV
      dose-1 or dose-2. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an increase in presumed flares
      following RZV vaccination. Among adults aged >/=50 years with IMIDs, a
      substantial proportion received RZV compared to general zoster coverage estimates
      and series-completion was high. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Trigeminal extracranial thermocoagulation along with patient-controlled analgesia
      with esketamine for refractory postherpetic neuralgia after herpes zoster
      ophthalmicus: A case report.
PG  - 4220-4225
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v10.i13.4220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary trigeminal neuralgia can achieve satisfactory results through
      clinical treatment and intervention. The pathogenesis of neuralgia caused by
      varicella-zoster virus infection of the trigeminal nerve is more complex, and it 
      is still difficult to relieve the pain in some patients simply by drug treatment 
      or surgical intervention. CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman was hospitalized with
      herpetic neuralgia after herpes zoster ophthalmicus (varicella-zoster virus
      infects the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve). On admission, the patient
      showed spontaneous, electric shock-like and acupuncture-like severe pain in the
      left frontal parietal region, and pain could be induced by touching the herpes
      area. The numerical rating scale (NRS) was 9. There was no significant pain
      relief after pulsed radiofrequency and thermocoagulation of the ophthalmic branch
      of the trigeminal nerve. Combined with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia
      (PCIA) with esketamine, neuralgia was significantly improved. The patient had no 
      spontaneous pain or allodynia at discharge, and the NRS score decreased to 2
      points. The results of follow-up 2 mo after discharge showed that the NRS score
      was </= 3, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 5 points. There were 
      no adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Trigeminal extracranial thermocoagulation
      combined with esketamine PCIA may be a feasible method for the treatment of
      refractory herpetic neuralgia after herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

TI  - Bomidin: An Optimized Antimicrobial Peptide With Broad Antiviral Activity Against
      Enveloped Viruses.
PG  - 851642
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.851642 [doi]
AB  - The rapid evolution of highly infectious pathogens is a major threat to global
      public health. In the front line of defense against bacteria, fungi, and viruses,
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally produced by all living organisms and 
      offer new possibilities for next-generation antibiotic development. However, the 
      low yields and difficulties in the extraction and purification of AMPs have
      hindered their industry and scientific research applications. To overcome these
      barriers, we enabled high expression of bomidin, a commercial recombinant AMP
      based upon bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide-27. This novel AMP, which can be 
      expressed in Escherichia coli by adding methionine to the bomidin sequence, can
      be produced in bulk and is more biologically active than chemically synthesized
      AMPs. We verified the function of bomidin against a variety of bacteria and
      enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2), herpes simplex virus (HSV), dengue virus (DENV), and chikungunya
      virus (CHIKV). Furthermore, based on the molecular modeling of bomidin and
      membrane lipids, we elucidated the possible mechanism by which bomidin disrupts
      bacterial and viral membranes. Thus, we obtained a novel AMP with an optimized,
      efficient heterologous expression system for potential therapeutic application
      against a wide range of life-threatening pathogens.

TI  - Bell's palsy as a possible complication of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine against
      COVID-19.
PG  - 103897
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103897 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Vero Cell, AstraZeneca, Janssen, mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Pfizer
      COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use in Nepal. These vacines 
      have been linked to some adverse effects, including fever, myalgia, and headache.
      Furthermore Bell's Palsy a rare adverse effect was also reported to be associated
      with the use of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine in some patients. Case presentation: 
      In this case report we present a 17-year-old female who acquired Bell's Palsy
      following the administration of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccination.
      Discussion: The possible etiology of BP that has been suggested is infection by
      reactivated viruses, such as the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex
      virus type 1 (HSV-1), human herpesvirus 6, and the Usutu virus, [1] the most
      accepted hypothesis is the one with reactivation of latent Herpes Simplex Virus
      type 1 in the geniculate ganglia of the facial nerves, an autoimmune mechanism
      through the mimicry of host molecules by the antigens of the vaccines.
      Conclusion: Though the extent of association between the mRNA vaccination and the
      development of Bell's Palsy has yet to be confirmed, this example highlights the 
      need to closely monitor side effects and repercussions after receiving a new
      vaccine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help to
      distinguish early stage autoimmune (AI) and herpes simplex virus (HSV)
      encephalitides. METHODS: This case-control study included patients from a
      multi-center cohort of AI encephalitides whose initial MRI including DWI was
      performed within ten days after symptoms onset. They were compared with patients 
      with HSV encephalitis enrolled prospectively in a single-center from June, 2020
      to December, 2020. The final diagnosis of AI encephalitis required a positive
      autoantibody assay, and that of HSV encephalitis required a positive HSV
      polymerase chain reaction based on cerebrospinal fluid. Brain MRI were evaluated 
      for restricted diffusion, fluid-inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities, lesion 
      topography, hemorrhagic changes, and contrast enhancement. RESULTS: Forty-nine
      patients were included of which, 19 (38.8%) had AI encephalitis. Twenty-seven
      patients (55.1%) were males and the median age was 46.0 years (interquartile
      range (IQR):[22.0; 65.0]). Brain MRI were performed after a median of 4 days
      (IQR:[2.0; 7.0]) of symptom onset and time between symptom onset and MRI was not 
      significantly different (p=0.60). Twenty-six patients had restricted diffusion
      lesions in the medial temporal lobe, including 25/30 in the HSV encephalitis
      group (p < 0.001). FLAIR abnormalities were observed in 36 patients, including
      29/30 in the HSV encephalitis group (p < 0.001). Lesion topography, hemorrhagic
      changes, and contrast enhancement did not differ significantly between the two
      groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that restricted diffusion lesions in the 
      medial temporal lobe are a hallmark of HSV encephalitis and may help distinguish 
      it from early-stage AI encephalitis.

AB  - Mapping neural circuits is critical for understanding the structure and function 
      of the nervous system. Engineered viruses are a valuable tool for tracing neural 
      circuits. However, current tracers do not fully meet the needs for this approach 
      because of various drawbacks, such as toxicity and characteristics that are
      difficult to modify. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new tracer
      with low toxicity and that allows for long-term studies. In this study, we
      constructed an engineered Sindbis virus (SINV) expressing enhanced green
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene (SINV-EGFP) and found that it had no
      significant difference in biological characterization compared with the wild-type
      Sindbis virus in BHK-21 cells and neurons in vitro. We injected the virus into
      the visual circuit of mouse brain and found that the virus infected neurons in
      the local injected site and anterogradely spread in the neural circuits. Although
      the efficiency of transmission was limited, the findings demonstrate that SINV
      can be used as a new anterograde tracer to map neural circuits in mouse brain and
      that it spreads exclusively in the anterograde direction. Further, use of SINV in
      mouse brain research will provide longer time windows for circuit tracing than is
      possible with herpes simplex virus and vesicular stomatitis virus tracers.

TI  - Immunological characteristics of MAV/06 strain of varicella-zoster virus vaccine 
      in an animal model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogen that causes chickenpox and
      shingles in humans. Different types of the varicella vaccines derived from the
      Oka and MAV/06 strains are commercially available worldwide. Although the MAV/06 
      vaccine was introduced in 1990s, little was known about immunological
      characteristics. RESULTS: Here, we evaluated B and T cell immune response in
      animals inoculated with the Oka and MAV/06 vaccines as well as a new formulation 
      of the MAV/06 vaccine. A variety of test methods were applied to evaluate T and B
      cell immune response. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and fluorescent
      antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) assay were conducted to measure the MAV/06
      vaccine-induced antibody activity against various VZVs. Glycoprotein
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) was used to compare the degree of the
      antibody responses induced by the two available commercial VZV vaccines and the
      MAV/06 vaccine. Interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (IFN-gamma
      ELISpot) assays and cytokine bead array (CBA) assays were conducted to
      investigate T cell immune responses. Antibodies induced by MAV/06 vaccination
      showed immunogenicity against a variety of varicella-zoster virus and
      cross-reactivity among the virus clades. CONCLUSIONS: It is indicating the
      similarity of the antibody responses induced by commercial varicella vaccines and
      the MAV/06 vaccine. Moreover, VZV-specific T cell immune response from MAV/06
      vaccination was increased via Th1 cell response. MAV/06 varicella vaccine induced
      both humoral and cellular immune response via Th1 cell mediated response.

TI  - Kaposi's sarcoma with gastric and rectal involvement in HIV patient.
LID - 10.17235/reed.2022.8880/2022 [doi]
AB  - A 67-year-old man admitted due to dyspnea, violaceous skin lesions and normocytic
      anemia under study. During admission, the patient is diagnosed with HIV infection
      in the AIDS phase, in addition to Kaposi's sarcoma with cutaneous, multiple
      digestive (gastric and rectal) and probably pulmonary involvement. Kaposi's
      sarcoma is a tumor of vascular origin caused by the human herpes virus type 8.
      There are four variants, our patient corresponds to the variant related to AIDS. 
      Gastrointestinal involvement presents varied symptoms and the endoscopic image is
      very characteristic, but as it is a tumor with submucosal involvement, it
      sometimes requires endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy to make the diagnosis.
      Treatment is based on antiretroviral therapy and systemic chemotherapy.

TI  - Kaposi's sarcoma management from a plastic surgery perspective.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/09546634.2022.2083544 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade angioproliferative tumor
      arising from endothelial cells and associated with Human Herpes Virus 8
      infection. Although there are considerable number of patients referred for
      surgical excision, the plastic surgery literature on KS is exceptionally scarce. 
      In this study, it was aimed to emphasize the differences in the management of
      Kaposi's Sarcoma and help to understand the importance of a multidisciplinary
      approach, accordingly the sake of choosing the ideal treatment method for each
      lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who were operated with the
      diagnosis of KS between March 2015 and January 2020 were included. Preoperative
      HIV tests and detailed whole-body examinations of the patients were performed. As
      a surgical method, for lesions with sizes ranging from 0.5 * 1 cm to 2 * 3 cm,
      excisions were made over the deep skin fascia by placing a margin between 0.5-1
      cm, considering the anatomical location and elasticity of the skin. RESULTS:
      Primary repair was performed in 23 patients (40 lesions) and 12 lesions of 8
      patients were repaired with a skin graft. In four patients the repair was
      performed with local skin flaps. In a patient with a lesion on the finger, the
      defect that occurred after the excision of the lesion was repaired with a
      pedicled regional flap. CONCLUSIONS: One-stage surgical excision of the lesions
      provides remarkable advantages, compared to the therapies such as radiotherapy,
      laser, or chemotherapy which require several administrations.

OAB - Kaposi's sarcoma is a vascular tumor with five different clinical forms. The
      lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma are seen in the skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes, and
      visceral organs. Most patients present with cutaneous lesions. In our study,
      surgical excision is performed for 57 cutaneous lesions of 30 patients. When we
      compared with literature data, higher upper extremity involvement, less systemic 
      involvement and less pronounced male predominance were considerable differences. 
      A multidisciplinary approach and the ideal treatment method for each lesion has
      remarkable importance in KS management.

TI  - Support Vector Machine versus Multiple Logistic Regression for Prediction of
      Postherpetic Neuralgia in Outpatients with Herpes Zoster.
PG  - E481-E488
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), as the most common complication of
      herpes zoster (HZ), is very refractory to current therapies. Studies of HZ have
      indicated that early aggressive pain interventions can effectively prevent PHN;
      therefore, accurately predicting PHN in outpatients with HZ and treating HZ
      promptly, would be of great benefit to patients. Multiple logistic regression
      (MLR) has often been used to predict PHN. However, support vector machine (SVM)
      has been poorly studied in predicting PHN in outpatients with HZ. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of our retrospective study was to analyze the data of outpatients with HZ to 
      evaluate the use of SVM for predicting PHN by comparing it with MLR. STUDY
      DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: Department of Anesthesiology in China.
      METHODS: The data of 732 outpatients with HZ from January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2020
      were reviewed. Risk factors for having PHN in outpatients with HZ were screened
      using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Then,
      SVM and MLR were used to predict PHN in outpatients with HZ based on screened
      risk factors. The data from 600 patients were used for training set and another
      132 patients for test set. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
      drawn from the 132 test set of patients. The prediction accuracy of the models
      was assessed using the area under curve (AUC). RESULTS: The incidence of having
      PHN in outpatients with HZ was 19.4%. The risk factors selected by LASSO
      algorithm were gender, age, VAS scores, skin lesion area, initial treatment time,
      anxiety, sites of HZ (multiple skin lesions), types of HZ (bullous) and types of 
      pain (knife cutting). The AUC for the SVM and MLR in test set were 0.884 versus
      0.853. According to the ROC curve, the specificity and the sensitivity were 0.879
      and 0.840 for SVM, and 0.780 and 0.840 for MLR, respectively. LIMITATIONS:
      Retrospective study and relatively small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Both SVM and
      MLR had good discriminative power, but SVM has better performance in predicting
      PHN in outpatients with HZ, regarding the prediction accuracy and specificity.

TI  - COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in pregnancy: Results of the Swiss COVI-PREG registry, an
      observational prospective cohort study.
PG  - 100410
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100410 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pregnant individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at 
      increased risk of severe disease, prematurity, and stillbirth. In March 2021,
      vaccination for at risk pregnant women was recommended in Switzerland, expanding 
      this to all pregnant women in May 2021. Our aim was to assess the safety of mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Methods: This multicentre prospective cohort
      study describes early adverse events and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women who
      received at least one dose of mRNA vaccine between March 1st and December 27th,
      2021 in Switzerland, using the COVI-PREG registry. Early adverse events were
      collected at least one month following vaccine administration. Pregnancy and
      neonatal outcomes were extracted from medical records using the maternity
      discharge letters providing follow-up information up to 5 days after birth.
      Findings: Of 1012 vaccinated women, 894 (88.3%) received both injections during
      pregnancy, with BNT162b2 (n = 271) or mRNA-1273 (n = 623) vaccines. Local events 
      (mainly local pain) were reported in 81.3% and 80.5% after the first and second
      doses. Rates of systemic reactions (mainly fatigue and headache) were similar
      after the first dose and most frequent after the second dose of mRNA-1273. Of the
      1012 women, four (0.4%; 95%CI [0.1-1.0]) severe early adverse events occurred:
      pulmonary embolism, preterm premature rupture of membranes, isolated fever with
      hospitalisation, and herpes zoster. Of 107 patients vaccinated before 14 weeks,
      one (0.9%; 95%CI [0.0-5.1]) early spontaneous abortions was reported (8 weeks).
      Of 228 vaccinated before 20 weeks one (0.4%; 95%CI [0.0-2.4]) late spontaneous
      abortion was reported (16 weeks). Of 513 women exposed before 37 weeks, 33 (6.4%;
      95%CI [4.5-8.9]) delivered preterm. Among 530 patients exposed in pregnancy, no
      stillbirth was reported and 25 (4.7%; 95%CI [3.0-6.8]) neonates were admitted to 
      intensive care unit. Interpretation: Frequent local and systemic effects were
      described after exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy but severe
      events were rare. Women vaccinated during pregnancy did not experience higher
      adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes when compared to historical data on
      background risks in the obstetric population. Funding: This research was funded
      by a grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the CHUV
      Foundation.

TI  - Effect of Implantable Electrical Nerve Stimulation on Cortical Dynamics in
      Patients With Herpes Zoster-Related Pain: A Prospective Pilot Study.
PG  - 862353
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.862353 [doi]
AB  - Implantable electrical nerve stimulation (ENS) can be used to treat neuropathic
      pain caused by herpes zoster. However, little is known about the cortical
      mechanism underlying neuromodulation therapy. Here, we recorded a 16-channel
      resting-state electroencephalogram after the application of spinal cord
      stimulation (n = 5) or peripheral nerve stimulation (n = 3). The neuromodulatory 
      effect was compared between specific conditions (active ENS versus rest). To
      capture the cortical responses of ENS, spectral power and coherence analysis were
      performed. ENS therapy achieved satisfactory relief from pain with a mean visual 
      analog scale score reduction of 5.9 +/- 1.1. The spectral analysis indicated that
      theta and alpha oscillations increased significantly during active
      neuromodulation compared with the resting state. Furthermore, ENS administration 
      significantly increased frontal-frontal coherence in the alpha band. Our findings
      demonstrate that, despite methodological differences, both spinal cord and
      peripheral nerve stimulation can induce cortical alpha oscillation changes in
      patients with zoster-related pain. The dynamic change may, in part, mediate the
      analgesic effect of ENS on herpes zoster-related pain.

TI  - Prevalence of and factors associated with herpes zoster in England: a
      cross-sectional analysis of the Health Survey for England.
PG  - 513
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07479-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (commonly called shingles) is caused by the
      reactivation of varicella zoster virus, and results in substantial morbidity.
      While the risk of zoster increases significantly with age and immunosuppression, 
      relatively little is known about other risk factors for zoster. Moreover, much
      evidence to date stems from electronic healthcare or administrative data. Hence, 
      the aim of this study was to explore potential risk factors for herpes zoster
      using survey data from a nationally-representative sample of the general
      community-dwelling population in England. METHODS: Data were extracted from the
      2015 Health Survey for England, an annual cross-sectional representative survey
      of households in England. The lifetime prevalence of self-reported herpes zoster 
      was described by age, gender and other socio-demographic factors, health
      behaviours (physical activity levels, body mass index, smoking status and alcohol
      consumption) and clinical conditions, including; diabetes, respiratory, digestive
      and genito-urinary system and mental health disorders. Logistic regression models
      were then used to identify possible factors associated with shingles, and results
      were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The
      lifetime prevalence of shingles among the sample was 11.5% (12.6% among women,
      10.3% among men), which increased with age. After adjusting for a range of
      covariates, increased age, female gender (odds ratio: 1.21; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.43),
      White ethnic backgrounds (odds ratio: 2.00; 95%CI: 1.40, 2.88), moderate physical
      activity 7 days per week (odds ratio: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.66) and digestive
      disorders (odds ratio: 1.51; 95%CI: 1.13, 1.51) were each associated with
      increased odds of having had herpes zoster. CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, ethnicity
      and digestive disorders may be risk factors for herpes zoster among a nationally 
      representative sample of adults in England. These potential risk factors and
      possible mechanisms should be further explored using longitudinal studies.

AB  - The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 points to unrivaled mutational variation of the
      virus, contributing to a variety of post-COVID sequelae in immunocompromised
      subjects and high mortality. Numerous studies have reported the reactivation of
      "sluggish" herpes virus infections in COVID-19, which exaggerate the course of
      the disease and complicate with lasting post-COVID manifestations CMV, EBV,
      HHV6). This study aimed to describe clinical and laboratory features of
      post-COVID manifestations accompanied by the reactivation of herpes virus
      infections (CMV, EBV, HHV6). 88 patients were recruited for this study, including
      subjects with reactivation of herpes viruses, 68 (72.3%) (main group) and 20
      (27.7%) subjects without detectable DNA of herpesviruses (control group): 46
      (52.3%) female and 42 (47.7%) male; median age was 41.4 +/- 6.7 years. Patients
      with post-COVID manifestations presented with reactivation of EBV in 42.6%, HHV6 
      in 25.0%, and EBV plus HHV6 in 32.4%. Compared with controls, patients with
      herpes virus infections presented with more frequent slight fever temperature,
      headache, psycho-neurological disorders, pulmonary abnormalities and myalgia (p <
      0.01), activation of liver enzymes, elevated CRP and D-dimer, and suppressed
      cellular immune response (p </= 0.05). Preliminary results indicate a likely
      involvement of reactivated herpes virus infections, primarily EBV infections in
      severe COVID-19 and the formation of the post-COVID syndrome. Patients with the
      post-COVID syndrome and reactivation of EBV and HHV6 infections are at high risk 
      of developing various pathologies, including rheumatologic diseases.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen that infects 50-90% of
      the world's population and causes a variety of diseases, some of which can be
      life-threatening. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been shown to have
      broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In this study, we investigated the activity of
      AgNPs against HSV-1 and found that AgNPs effectively inhibited plaque formation
      and HSV-1 progeny production, reduced the genomic load, and interfered with HSV-1
      mRNA expression and protein synthesis. Transmission electron microscopy showed
      that AgNPs interacted with HSV-1 and altered the shape of the viral particles.
      Furthermore, AgNPs affected the entry of HSV-1 into cells as well as their
      release and cell-to-cell spread. AgNPs were also found to downregulate the
      expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon HSV-1 infection. Combined treatment
      with AgNPs and acyclovir (ACV) confirmed that AgNPs significantly enhanced the
      inhibitory effect of ACV against HSV-1. Our findings may contribute to an
      understanding of the mechanism of the antiviral effect of AgNPs against HSV-1 and
      help to provide a theoretical basis for their clinical application.

TI  - Long-term Risk of Herpes Zoster Infection in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis
      Receiving Tofacitinib.
LID - izac063 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izac063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor for the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We report herpes zoster (HZ) incidence and 
      risk factors in the tofacitinib UC clinical program (up to 7.8 years). METHODS:
      Proportions and incidence rates (IRs; unique patients with events/100
      patient-years) of HZ were evaluated in 4 cohorts: Induction (phase 2 and 3
      induction study data), Maintenance (phase 3 maintenance study data), Overall
      (data from all phase 2, 3, and open-label, long-term extension studies), and
      Overall plus interim 6-month phase 3b and 4 data. Herpes zoster risk factors were
      assessed by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: In the Induction and Maintenance
      Cohorts, IRs for HZ (nonserious and serious) were numerically higher with
      tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily (BID) vs placebo and tofacitinib 10 vs 5 mg BID,
      respectively. With all tofacitinib doses (5 or 10 mg BID), IRs (95% confidence
      intervals) for HZ in the Overall and Overall plus phase 3b/4 Cohorts (total
      exposure, 2814.4 and 2999.7 patient-years, respectively) were 3.38 (2.73-4.15)
      and 3.30 (2.67-4.04), respectively. In the Overall plus phase 3b/4 Cohort, >90%
      of HZ were nonserious; >90% were mild/moderate; >90% resolved without
      discontinuing tofacitinib; 0.6% of patients had multiple HZ events. Herpes zoster
      IRs were stable when analyzed by 6-month intervals up to >30 months. Herpes
      zoster risk factors included older age, lower weight, geographic region, and
      prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure. CONCLUSIONS: Most HZ events
      were mild/moderate. Herpes zoster IRs remained stable over 7.8 years of exposure.
      Older age, lower weight, geographic region, and prior TNFi failure were
      associated with increased HZ risk. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV:

TI  - Antiviral Effect of Polyphenolic Substances in Geranium wilfordii Maxim against
      HSV-2 Infection Using in vitro and in silico Approaches.
PG  - 7953728
LID - 10.1155/2022/7953728 [doi]
AB  - Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infestation was the most
      widespread STD (sexually transmitted diseases) among humans and was the leading
      cause of infectious recurrent genital herpes. Existing therapies against HSV-2
      did incompletely restrain the comeback of activated HSV-2 infestation. Geranium
      wilfordii Maxim had long been used as traditional Chinese medicine for treating
      the diseases owing to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. Herein, the
      study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of G.wilfordii and its
      potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. Methods: To identify
      the stage of infection at which the compounds inhibited HSV-2, we performed
      virucidal, therapeutic, and prophylactic assays. The antiviral efficacy was
      evaluated by the analysis of viral components HSV-2 gD and VP16. The antiviral
      activities of these compounds were also evaluated by phenotypic analysis, such as
      cell proliferation and apoptosis. Molecular docking studies on candidate
      compounds were done to indicate binding interactions between the compounds and
      adopted compound targets. Results: Quercetin, corilagin, and geraniin inhibited
      the replication of HSV-2, with geraniin showing greater TI. The obtained IC50
      value of quercetin was 204.7 muM and TI (IC50/EC50) was 5.1, whereas the obtained
      IC50 value of corilagin was 118.0 mug/ml and TI was 4.05. Geraniin exhibited
      prominent antiviral activity with an IC50 of 212.4 muM and an EC50 of 18.37 muM, 
      resulting in a therapeutic index (TI) of 11.56. Geraniin showed important in
      vitro virucidal activity through blocking viral attachment. Compared with the
      virus group, the apoptosis rates in quercetin-, corilagin-, and geraniin-treated 
      groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.001).The expressions at the
      transcription genes of virus own replication key factors (including HSV-2 gD and 
      VP16) and cytokines (including TBK1) of infected cells treated with quercetin,
      corilagin, and geraniin were inhibited. The in silico approaches demonstrated a
      high number of potential strong intermolecular interactions as hydrogen bonds
      between geraniin, corilagin, and the activity site of HSV-2 gD. Molecular docking
      studies demonstrated the effects of corilagin by targeting TBK1. Conclusions:
      Together, these results highlighted the importance of G.wilfordii treatment in
      HSV-2 infection and underscored its therapeutic potential. However, additional in
      vitro and in vivo research was required to validate our findings.

AB  - We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented to the emergency
      department with acute retinal necrosis in her left eye secondary to herpes
      simplex virus type 1 encephalitis for which she had been hospitalized four months
      before. Treatment with intravitreal foscarnet and intravenous acyclovir was
      promptly commenced followed by the addition of oral prednisolone. PCR analysis of
      aqueous humor detected HSV type 1 DNA. The condition responded to therapy with
      partial resolution of intraocular inflammation and improvement of visual acuity, 
      but the presence of Kyrieleis plaques was observed two weeks after the initiation
      of treatment, when five intravitreal foscarnet injections had been administered. 
      The patient was switched to oral therapy with valacyclovir, and 10 weeks after
      commencing treatment, the patient's left eye was free of inflammation, having
      achieved a BCVA of 20/20. Oral steroid treatment was gradually tapered off, and
      the patient was instructed to remain on prophylactic antiviral therapy. Kyrieleis
      arteriolitis is an uncommon finding in the context of acute retinal necrosis. As 
      far as we are aware, we report the first case of Kyrieleis arteriolitis in acute 
      retinal necrosis secondary to viral encephalitis and the second one presenting
      Kyrieleis plaques in acute retinal necrosis caused by herpes simplex virus type
      1. Prior reports of cases of Kyrieleis arteriolitis in acute retinal necrosis are
      also presented.

TI  - Trigeminal Herpes Zoster Transited to Ipsilateral Occipital Neuralgia.
PG  - 437-440
LID - 10.3390/neurolint14020036 [doi]
AB  - The pain of occipital neuralgia (ON) is thought to be secondary to trauma or
      injury to the occipital nerve at any point along the course of the nerve. ON may 
      also be caused by an infectious process (herpes zoster) or compression of the
      nerve. The patient, in this case, presented to our clinic with complaints of
      occipital pain and rash and swelling of the right lower jaw. One week before
      presenting to our clinic, the patient developed severe pain in the first division
      of the trigeminal region with erythema and vesicles. A blood test showed a
      remarkably high antibody titer for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The patient was 
      prescribed oral valacyclovir (Valtrex((R))) (3000 mg/day), which resulted in the 
      complete remission of the rash and blisters in the occipital region. This
      highlights the importance of considering neuroanatomy of the trigeminal region
      and cervical nerve.

      in Rural Arizona: Implications for Community Health Practice.
PG  - 243-252
LID - 10.3390/clinpract12030029 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated a pharmacist-led telephonic Medication Therapy Management
      (MTM) program for rural patients in Arizona with poor access to healthcare
      services. A pharmacist provided telephonic MTM services to eligible adult
      patients living in rural Arizona communities with a diagnosis of diabetes and/or 
      hypertension. Data were collected and summarized descriptively for demographic
      and health conditions, clinical values, and medication-related problems (MRPs) at
      the initial consultation, and follow-up data collected at 1 and 3 months. A total
      of 33 patients had baseline and one-month follow-up data, while 15 patients also 
      had three-month follow-up data. At the initial consultation, the following MRPs
      were identified: medication adherence issues, dose-related concerns, adverse drug
      events (ADE), high-risk medications, and therapeutic duplications.
      Recommendations were made for patients to have the influenza, herpes zoster, and 
      pneumonia vaccines; and to initiate a statin, angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, and/or rescue inhaler. In 
      conclusion, this study demonstrated that while pharmacists can identify and make 
      clinical recommendations to patients, the value of these interventions is not
      fully realized due to recommendations not being implemented and difficulties with
      patient follow-up, which may have been due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional
      efforts to address these shortcomings are therefore required.

TI  - The association of family history of herpes zoster and the risk of incident
      herpes zoster: the SHEZ Study.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1265/ehpm.21-00020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated whether family histories of herpes zoster (HZ) are
      associated with the risk of incident HZ in a Japanese population. METHODS: A
      total of 12,522 Japanese residents aged >/=50 years in Shozu County participated 
      in the baseline survey between December 2008 and November 2009 (the participation
      rate = 72.3%). They were interviewed at baseline by research physicians regarding
      the registrants' history of HZ. A self-administered questionnaire survey was
      conducted to evaluate the potential confounding factors. 10,530 participants
      without a history of HZ were followed up to ascertain the incidence of HZ during 
      3-years follow-up until the end of November 2012 with Japanese nationals. We
      estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of incident HZ according to first-degree family
      histories using the Cox proportional hazard regression after adjusting for age,
      sex, and other potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Compared to no HZ history 
      of each family member, a history of brother or sister was associated with a
      higher risk of incident HZ while histories of father and mother were not. The
      multivariable HR (95%CI) of incident HZ for a history of brother or sister was
      1.67 (1.04-2.69). When comparing to no family histories of all first-degree
      relatives, the multivariable HRs (95%CIs) were 1.34 (0.77-2.34) for a history of 
      brother or sister alone, but 4.81 (1.78-13.00) for a history of mother plus
      brother or sister. As for the number of family histories, the multivariable HRs
      (95%CIs) were 1.08 (0.76-1.54) for one relative (father, mother, or brother or
      sister) and 2.75 (1.13-6.70) for two or more relatives. CONCLUSION: Family
      histories of mother plus brother or sister and two or more first-degree relatives
      were associated with a higher risk of incident HZ.

TI  - Ozone Therapy for Dermatological Conditions: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - Background: Known in the past for its toxic aspect as the main urban pollutant,
      in the last few decades, ozone has been gaining greater visibility for its
      possible antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant effects when used in human
      dermatological pathologies. Despite the reports of clinical benefits, the
      standard dosage for clinical efficacy and safety are yet not clear, nor are its
      means of application and its true acting mechanism. Objective: We conducted a
      review to determine the efficacy and safety of ozone therapy for a variety of
      dermatological conditions. Methods: We considered clinical trials (both
      randomized and non-randomized) published between December 2020 and March 2021 as 
      long as they provided some PICO information, i.e., population (P), intervention
      (I), and study design. The skin dermatological conditions researched were: acne, 
      dermatitis, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, herpes, aging, ulcers, and skin
      scarring. Results: A total of 326 articles were identified and 150 remained after
      duplicates were removed. After titles, abstracts and full articles were read, 17 
      articles were included in the systematic review (with 643 patients). Conclusion: 
      Ozone therapy seems promising for some dermatological conditions; however, the
      articles included in this review had methodological limitations and did not
      sufficiently demonstrate sound evidence for safe therapy. Therefore, more studies
      with better methodological standards and longer-term assessments of side effects 
      should be conducted to achieve better standards and safety in ozone therapy for
      dermatological conditions.

PG  - 18-21
LID - 10.17116/stomat202210103118 [doi]
AB  - THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The study by the method of tissue polymerase chain reaction
      of the species composition of the microbiota of lesions of the oral mucosa in
      patients with bullous lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens of the oral
      mucosa of 51 patients were studied by the polymerase chain reaction method, of
      which 14 patients with pemphigus vulgaris, 17 patients with pemphigoid bullosa,
      and 20 patients with the bullous form of ruber lichen planus. 4 types of
      microorganisms have been identified - Fusobacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      Candida albicans, Ureaplasma spp. and viruses - Human Papillomavirus 16,
      Epstein-Barr virus and Citomegalovirus. RESULTS: In the study of the microbiota
      of bullous lesions, associations of microorganisms and viruses were established
      in a significant number of cases. Associations of Str.pneumoniae and C. albicans 
      were quite common in patients with pemphigus vulgaris in 26.3%, pemphigoid
      bullosa in 20.0%, and in patients with the bullous form of ruber lichen planus in
      14.3% of cases. In patients with pemphigus vulgaris, the association of
      Str.pneumoniae, C. albicans and EBV was noted in 31.6% of cases. In patients with
      the bullous form of ruber lichen planus in a high percentage of cases (28.6%),
      the associations of Str. pneumoniae, EBV and CMV. CONCLUSION: Identification at
      earlier stages of management of patients with bullous lesions Str. pneumoniae,
      Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium associated with herpes viruses should be
      regarded as one of the triggering mechanisms of an autoimmune conflict, which
      subsequently causes a specific clinical picture of these diseases.

      case report and review of literature.
LID - 10.1308/rcsann.2022.0044 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex oesophagitis is rare, especially in immunocompetent patients. A
      78-year-old man presented with sepsis on the background of several months of
      retrosternal chest pain and fatigue. Computed tomography of the chest abdomen and
      pelvis revealed a large mediastinal collection and an
      oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy demonstrated a healed mucosal scar from a
      spontaneously healed perforation. The collection was successfully drained with an
      ultrasound-guided drain and the patient made a full recovery. Spontaneous
      oesophageal perforation from herpes simplex oesophagitis has been reported five
      times in the literature, with only two occurrences in immunocompetent
      individuals.

TI  - Using plasma proteomics to investigate viral infections of the central nervous

AB  - State-of-the-art liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based proteomic 
      technologies, using microliter amounts of patient plasma, can detect and quantify
      several hundred plasma proteins in a high throughput fashion, allowing for the
      discovery of clinically relevant protein biomarkers and insights into the
      underlying pathobiological processes. Using such an in-house developed high
      throughput plasma proteomics allowed us to identify and quantify > 400 plasmas
      proteins in 15 min per sample, i.e., a throughput of 100 samples/day. We
      demonstrated the clinical applicability of our method in this pilot study by
      mapping the plasma proteomes from patients infected with human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) or herpes virus, both groups with involvement of the central nervous 
      system (CNS). We found significant disease-specific differences in the plasma
      proteomes. The most notable difference was a decrease in the levels of several
      coagulation-associated proteins in HIV vs. herpes virus, among other dysregulated
      biological pathways providing insight into the differential pathophysiology of
      HIV compared to herpes virus infection. In a subsequent analysis, we found
      several plasma proteins associated with immunity and metabolism to differentiate 
      patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) compared to
      cognitively normal people with HIV (PWH), suggesting the presence of plasma-based
      biomarkers to distinguishing HAND from cognitively normal PWH. Overall, our
      high-throughput plasma proteomics pipeline enables the identification of distinct
      proteomic signatures of HIV and herpes virus, which may help illuminate divergent
      pathophysiology behind virus-associated neurological disorders.

TI  - Mouse Mx1 Inhibits Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Genomic Replication and Late Gene 
      Expression In Vitro and Prevents Lesion Formation in the Mouse Zosteriform Model.
PG  - e0041922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00419-22 [doi]
AB  - Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are dynamin-like GTPases that are inducible by
      interferons (IFNs) following virus infections. Most studies investigating Mx
      proteins have focused on their activity against influenza A viruses (IAV),
      although emerging evidence suggests that some Mx proteins may exhibit broader
      antiviral activity. Herein, we demonstrate that in addition to IAV,
      overexpression of mouse Mx1 (mMx1), but not mMx2, resulted in potent inhibition
      of growth of the human alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and
      HSV-2, whereas neither inhibited the mouse betaherpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus
      (MCMV) in vitro. IFN induction of a functional endogenous mMx1 in primary mouse
      fibroblasts ex vivo was also associated with inhibition of HSV-1 growth. Using an
      in vitro overexpression approach, we demonstrate that mutations that result in
      redistribution of mMx1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or in loss of its
      combined GTP binding and GTPase activity also abrogated its ability to inhibit
      HSV-1 growth. Overexpressed mMx1 did not inhibit early HSV-1 gene expression but 
      was shown to inhibit both replication of the HSV-1 genome as well as subsequent
      late gene expression. In a mouse model of cutaneous HSV-1 infection, mice
      expressing a functional endogenous mMx1 showed significant reductions in the
      severity of skin lesions as well as reduced HSV-1 titers in both the skin and
      dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Together, these data demonstrate that mMx1 mediates
      potent antiviral activity against human alphaherpesviruses by blocking
      replication of the viral genome and subsequent steps in virus replication.
      Moreover, endogenous mMx1 potently inhibited pathogenesis in the zosteriform
      mouse model of HSV-1 infection. IMPORTANCE While a number of studies have
      demonstrated that human Mx proteins can inhibit particular herpesviruses in
      vitro, we are the first to report the antiviral activity of mouse Mx1 (mMx1)
      against alphaherpesviruses both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that both
      overexpressed mMx1 and endogenous mMx1 potently restrict HSV-1 growth in vitro.
      mMx1-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 was not associated with inhibition of virus
      entry and/or import of the viral genome into the nucleus, but rather with
      inhibition of HSV-1 genomic replication as well as subsequent late gene
      expression. Therefore, inhibition of human alphaherpesviruses by mMx1 occurs by a
      mechanism that is distinct from that reported for human Mx proteins against
      herpesviruses. Importantly, we also provide evidence that expression of a
      functional endogenous mMx1 can limit HSV-1 pathogenesis in a mouse model of
      infection.

AB  - Herpes zoster (HZ) is usually distributed on one side of the body; HZ duplex
      bilateralis is very rare with only 0.1% of all HZ cases. The occurrence of HZ
      duplex bilateralis is associated with abnormal immune function. In this report,
      we present a case of a 47-year-old woman who had no major health issues developed
      HZ duplex bilateralis after an adverse life event and extreme depression one
      month ago. HZ related symptoms were controlled after patient received antiviral, 
      analgesic, and nerve-nourishing treatment in our hospital.

TI  - Agent-based computational modeling of glioblastoma predicts that stromal density 
      is central to oncolytic virus efficacy.
PG  - 104395
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104395 [doi]
AB  - Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging cancer immunotherapy. Despite notable
      successes in the treatment of some tumors, OV therapy for central nervous system 
      cancers has failed to show efficacy. We used an ex vivo tumor model developed
      from human glioblastoma tissue to evaluate the infiltration of herpes simplex OV 
      rQNestin (oHSV-1) into glioblastoma tumors. We next leveraged our data to develop
      a computational, model of glioblastoma dynamics that accounts for cellular
      interactions within the tumor. Using our computational model, we found that low
      stromal density was highly predictive of oHSV-1 therapeutic success, suggesting
      that the efficacy of oHSV-1 in glioblastoma may be determined by stromal-to-tumor
      cell regional density. We validated these findings in heterogenous patient
      samples from brain metastatic adenocarcinoma. Our integrated modeling strategy
      can be applied to suggest mechanisms of therapeutic responses for central nervous
      system cancers and to facilitate the successful translation of OVs into the
      clinic.

PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s13027-022-00427-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to consider whether multiple pathogens have
      roles in prostate cancer. METHODS: We have reviewed case control studies in which
      infectious pathogens in prostate cancer were compared to normal and benign
      prostate tissues. We also reviewed additional evidence from relevant published
      articles. RESULTS: We confirmed that high risk human papilloma viruses are a
      probable cause of prostate cancer. We judged Escherichia coli, Cutibacterium
      acnes, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Herpes simplex, Epstein Barr virus and Mycoplasmas
      as each having possible but unproven roles in chronic prostatic inflammation and 
      prostate cancer. We judged Cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas
      vaginalis and the Polyoma viruses as possible but unlikely to have a role in
      prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND ACTIONS: The most influential cause of prostate 
      cancer appears to be infection induced chronic inflammation. Given the high
      prevalence of prostate cancer it is important for action to can be taken without 
      waiting for additional conclusive evidence. These include: 1. Encouragement of
      all boys (as well as girls) to have HPV vaccines 2. The vigorous use of
      antibiotics to treat all bacterial pathogens identified in the urogenital tract
      3. The use of antiviral medications to control herpes infections 4. Education
      about safe sexual practices.

AB  - We previously showed that the anti-fungal drug ciclopirox olamine effectively
      inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2. Given the rise of
      HSV strains that are resistant to nucleos(t)ide analog treatment, as well as the 
      incomplete efficacy of nucleos(t)ide analogs, new inhibitory compounds must be
      explored for potential use in the treatment of HSV infection. In the present
      study, we analyzed 44 compounds derived from the core structure of ciclopirox
      olamine for inhibitory activity against HSV. Thirteen of these derivative
      compounds inhibited HSV-2 replication by > 1000- to approximately 100,000-fold at
      1 muM and displayed EC50 values lower than that of acyclovir, as well as low
      cytotoxicity, indicating their strong therapeutic potential. Through structural
      comparison, we also provide evidence for the importance of various structural
      motifs to the efficacy of ciclopirox and its derivatives, namely hydrophobic
      groups at R(4) and R(6) of the ciclopirox core structure. Like ciclopirox,
      representative analogs exhibit some oral bioavailability but are rapidly cleared 
      in vivo. Together, these results will guide further development of
      N-hydroxypyridones as HSV therapeutics.

TI  - Capturing the value of vaccination: impact of vaccine-preventable disease on
      hospitalization.
PG  - 1551-1561
LID - 10.1007/s40520-022-02110-2 [doi]
AB  - Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that vaccine-preventable disease
      (VPD) such as influenza or herpes zoster contribute significantly to the
      increased risk of older adults for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neurological,
      and renal complications in the period after illnesses. However, since the period 
      of elevated risk can persist well beyond the duration of the acute illness, the
      connection is not always recognized. To obtain insights into the relationship
      between diagnoses for vaccine-preventable disease and for other conditions, we
      analyzed principal and secondary diagnoses for 3,127,768 inpatient admissions of 
      adults 50 years and older in the United States, using medical insurance claims
      drawn from the IBM((R)) MarketScan((R)) Research Databases (Marketscan). The
      Marketscan data indicated that overall, 3.1% of these hospitalizations had a
      principal diagnosis of VPD with variation by month of admission, and age.
      However, hospitalizations with a principal non-VPD diagnosis but secondary VPD
      diagnoses were 2.8 times more frequent, with particularly high rates in those
      whose principal diagnoses were non-VPD respiratory or circulatory disease.
      Hospitalized patients with a secondary VPD diagnosis tended to have poorer
      discharge outcomes, and longer length of stay in comparison to hospitalized
      patients without a secondary VPD diagnosis. In total, these data are consistent
      with suggestions that VPDs play a significant and potentially under-estimated
      role in hospitalization and outcomes, which may be potentially preventable by
      improved vaccination coverage.

PG  - 469-472
LID - 10.31729/jnma.7440 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Chickenpox is an acute, highly infectious disease. Outbreaks can
      occur in adults in closed institutional settings like hostels and barracks. This 
      study aims to report varicella zoster outbreak among male military personnel in a
      military training centre. Methods: An outbreak investigation of chickenpox in a
      military training school and tertiary hospital was conducted. Ethical approval
      was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 267). Data
      was collected from February 5, 2020 to April 10, 2020 by questionnaire and
      clinical examination. Case definitions were prepared as per the Centre for
      Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Data was entered and analysed in
      Microsoft Excel 2010. Results: Out of the 167 male personnel in the training
      centre, 90 (53.89%) were susceptible to varicella and 84 (50.29%) were close
      contacts. The secondary attack rate of varicella zoster was 21.43% (18 cases).
      The mean age of the patients was 22.33+/-1.72 years. The mean days of admission
      were 5+/-2.28 days. The most common clinical features were generalised rash in 18
      (100%), fever in 15 (83.33%), and body ache in 12 (66.67%) cases. Conclusions:
      Natural history, clinical, and epidemiological features of varicella zoster in a 
      closed institutional setting was studied with the secondary attack rate being
      less as compared to other studies. Keywords: chickenpox; military; outbreak.

TI  - Therapeutic outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with hypertrophic herpes 
      simplex infection treated with imiquimod: A systematic review and meta-analysis
      of individual patient data from case reports and case series.
LID - 10.1111/1346-8138.16446 [doi]
AB  - Hypertrophic herpes simplex (HHS) often has atypical presentations, such as a
      hypertrophic mass or ulcers, with chronic courses. This situation poses a
      diagnostic challenge and results in delayed treatment. Imiquimod was used as a
      treatment for HHS by several studies, but the therapeutic outcomes varied. This
      systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data was conducted to
      investigate the therapeutic outcomes and prognostic factors of imiquimod
      treatment for patients with HHS. Biomedical databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline,
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for
      all types of clinical studies reporting the complete cure rate and the time to
      complete response to imiquimod therapy between 1926 and 2021. Quantitative
      analysis of individual patient data was performed using multivariable flexible
      parametric survival regression with cluster variance correction. A total of 12
      019 articles were identified and screened for eligibility. Twenty-five studies
      (21 case reports and four case series) with a combined total of 42 patients were 
      included. The complete cure rate for imiquimod treatment was estimated at 88.1%. 
      The median time to complete response was 60 days (95% confidence interval 35-70).
      Combined treatment, male sex, and an age less than 50 years were identified as
      significant prognostic factors for a shorter time to complete cure. A severe
      local reaction was reported in 2.3%. Imiquimod therapy has high effectiveness and
      safety in curing HHS. Patients who were male or younger than 50 years or whose
      treatments were combined with thymidine kinase-dependent antivirals had the best 
      prognoses and were more likely to respond to treatment.

TI  - Stress Hormones Epinephrine and Corticosterone Selectively Reactivate HSV-1 and
      HSV-2 in Sympathetic and Sensory Neurons.
LID - 1115 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051115 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) establish latency in sensory and
      autonomic neurons, from which they can reactivate to cause recurrent disease
      throughout the life of the host. Stress is strongly associated with HSV
      recurrences in humans and animal models. However, the mechanisms through which
      stress hormones act on the latent virus to cause reactivation are unknown. We
      show that the stress hormones epinephrine (EPI) and corticosterone (CORT) induce 
      HSV-1 reactivation selectively in sympathetic neurons, but not sensory or
      parasympathetic neurons. Activation of multiple adrenergic receptors is necessary
      for EPI-induced HSV-1 reactivation, while CORT requires the glucocorticoid
      receptor. In contrast, CORT, but not EPI, induces HSV-2 reactivation in both
      sensory and sympathetic neurons through either glucocorticoid or
      mineralocorticoid receptors. Reactivation is dependent on different transcription
      factors for EPI and CORT, and coincides with rapid changes in viral gene
      expression, although genes differ for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and temporal kinetics
      differ for EPI and CORT. Thus, stress-induced reactivation mechanisms are
      neuron-specific, stimulus-specific and virus-specific. These findings have
      implications for differences in HSV-1 and HSV-2 recurrent disease patterns and
      frequencies, as well as development of targeted, more effective antivirals that
      may act on different responses in different types of neurons.

LID - 10.3390/v14051046 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), an alpha subgroup member of the human
      herpesvirus family, infects cells via the binding of its various envelope
      glycoproteins to cellular membrane receptors, one of which is herpes virus entry 
      mediator (HVEM), expressed on dendritic cells. Here, HVEM gene-deficient mice
      were used to investigate the immunologic effect elicited by the HSV-1 infection
      of dendritic cells. Dendritic cells expressing the surface marker CD11c showed an
      abnormal biological phenotype, including the altered transcription of various
      immune signaling molecules and inflammatory factors associated with innate
      immunity after viral replication. Furthermore, the viral infection of dendritic
      cells interfered with dendritic cell function in the lymph nodes, where these
      cells normally play roles in activating the T-cell response. Additionally, the
      mild clinicopathological manifestations observed during the acute phase of HSV-1 
      infection were associated with viral replication in dendritic cells.

LID - 1019 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051019 [doi]
AB  - HLA-B*57:01 is an HLA allelic variant associated with positive outcomes during
      viral infections through interactions with T cells and NK cells, but severe
      disease in persons treated with the anti-HIV-1 drug abacavir. The role of
      HLA-B*57:01 in the context of HSV infection is unknown. We identified an
      HLA-B*57:01-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope in the ICP22 (US1) protein of HSV-2.
      CD8 T cells reactive to the HSV-2 ICP22 epitope recognized the orthologous HSV-1 
      peptide, but not closely related peptides in human IFNL2 or IFNL3. Abacavir did
      not alter the CD8 T-cell recognition of the HSV or self-derived peptides.
      Unexpectedly, a tetramer of HSV-2 ICP22 epitope (228-236) and HLA-B*57:01 bound
      both CD8 T cells and NK cells. Tetramer specificity for KIR3DL1 was confirmed
      using KIR3DL1 overexpression on non-human primate cells lacking human KIR and
      studies with blocking anti-KIR3DL1 antibody. Interaction with KIR3DL1 was
      generalizable to donors lacking the HLA-B*57:01 genotype or HSV seropositivity.
      These findings suggest a mechanism for the recognition of HSV infection by NK
      cells or KIR-expressing T cells via KIR3DL1.

TI  - The Biology of Varicella-Zoster Virus Replication in the Skin.
LID - 982 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050982 [doi]
AB  - The replication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in skin is critical to its
      pathogenesis and spread. Primary infection causes chickenpox, which is
      characterised by centrally distributed skin blistering lesions that are rich in
      infectious virus. Cell-free virus in the cutaneous blistering lesions not only
      spreads to cause further cases, but infects sensory nerve endings, leading to the
      establishment of lifelong latency in sensory and autonomic ganglia. The
      reactivation of virus to cause herpes zoster is again characterised by localised 
      painful skin blistering rash containing infectious virus. The development of in
      vitro and in vivo models of VZV skin replication has revealed aspects of VZV
      replication and pathogenesis in this important target organ and improved our
      understanding of the vaccine strain vOKa attenuation. In this review, we outline 
      the current knowledge on VZV interaction with host signalling pathways, the viral
      association with proteins associated with epidermal terminal differentiation, and
      how these interconnect with the VZV life cycle to facilitate viral replication
      and shedding.

TI  - Depo Medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) Promotes Papillomavirus Infections but Does Not
      Accelerate Disease Progression in the Anogenital Tract of a Mouse Model.
LID - 980 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050980 [doi]
AB  - Contraceptives such as Depo-medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) are used by an estimated
      34 million women worldwide. DMPA has been associated with increased risk of
      several viral infections including Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and Human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the current study, we used the mouse
      papillomavirus (MmuPV1) anogenital infection model to test two hypotheses: (1)
      contraceptives such as DMPA increase the susceptibility of the anogenital tract
      to viral infection and (2) long-term contraceptive administration induces more
      advanced disease at the anogenital tract. DMPA treatments of both athymic nude
      mice and heterozygous NU/J (Foxn1(nu/+)) but ovariectomized mice led to a
      significantly increased viral load at the anogenital tract, suggesting that
      endogenous sex hormones were involved in increased viral susceptibility by DMPA
      treatment. Consistent with previous reports, DMPA treatment suppressed host
      anti-viral activities at the lower genital tract. To test the impact of long-term
      contraceptive treatment on the MmuPV1-infected lower genital tract, we included
      two other treatments in addition to DMPA: 17beta-estradiol and a non-hormone
      based contraceptive Cilostazol (CLZ, Pletal). Viral infections were monitored
      monthly up to nine months post infection by qPCR. The infected vaginal and anal
      tissues were harvested and further examined by histological, virological, and
      immunological analyses. Surprisingly, we did not detect a significantly higher
      grade of histology in animals in the long-term DMPA and 17beta-estradiol treated 
      groups when compared to the control groups in the athymic mice we tested.
      Therefore, although DMPA promotes initial papillomavirus infections in the lower 
      genital tract, the chronic administration of DMPA does not promote cancer
      development in the infected tissues in our mouse model.

TI  - Deletion of the CTRL2 Insulator in HSV-1 Results in the Decreased Expression of
      Genes Involved in Axonal Transport and Attenuates Reactivation In Vivo.
LID - 909 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050909 [doi]
AB  - HSV-1 is a human pathogen that establishes a lifelong infection in the host.
      HSV-1 is transported by retrograde axonal transport to sensory neurons in the
      peripheral nervous system where latent viral genomes can reactivate. The
      resulting virus travels via anterograde axonal transport to the periphery and can
      cause clinical disease. CTCF insulators flank the LAT and IE regions of HSV-1 and
      during latency and maintain the integrity of transcriptional domains through a
      myriad of functions, including enhancer-blocking or barrier-insulator functions. 
      Importantly, during reactivation, CTCF protein is evicted from the HSV-1 genome, 
      especially from the CTRL2 insulator. CTRL2 is a functional insulator downstream
      of the 5'exon region of the LAT, so these results suggest that the disruption of 
      this insulator may be required for efficient HSV-1 reactivation. To further
      explore this, we used a recombinant virus containing a deletion of the CTRL2
      insulator (DeltaCTRL2) in a rabbit ocular model of HSV-1 infection and induced
      reactivation. We show that, in the absence of the CTRL2 insulator, HSV-1
      established an equivalent latent infection in rabbits, but those rabbits failed
      to efficiently reactivate from latency. Furthermore, we found a significant
      decrease in the expression of the gene Us9-, a gene that codes for a type II
      membrane protein that has been shown to be required for anterograde transport in 
      neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that the functions of the CTRL2
      insulator and Us9 activation in reactivating neurons are intrinsically linked
      through the regulation of a gene responsible for the axonal transport of HSV-1 to
      the periphery.

TI  - Efficacy of an HSV-1 Neuro-Attenuated Vaccine in Mice Is Reduced by Preventing
      Viral DNA Replication.
LID - 869 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050869 [doi]
AB  - We previously isolated an HSV-1 mutant, KOS-NA, that contains two non-synonymous 
      mutations in UL39. One of the mutations, resulting in an R950H amino acid
      substitution in ICP6, renders KOS-NA severely neuro-attenuated and significantly 
      reduces HSV-1 latency. Vaccination of mice with KOS-NA prior to corneal challenge
      provides significant protection against HSV-1-mediated eye diseases even at a
      very low immunizing dose, indicating its utility as a vaccine scaffold. Because
      KOS-NA contains a neuro-attenuating mutation in a single gene, we sought to
      improve its safety by deleting a portion of the UL29 gene whose protein product, 
      ICP8, is essential for viral DNA replication. Whereas KOS-NA reduced replication 
      of HSV-1 challenge virus in the corneal epithelium and protected mice against
      blepharitis and keratitis induced by the challenge virus, KOS-NA/8- and an ICP8- 
      virus were significantly less efficacious except at higher doses. Our results
      suggest that the capacity to replicate, even at significantly reduced levels
      compared with wild-type HSV-1, may be an important feature of an effective
      vaccine. Means to improve safety of attenuated viruses as vaccines without
      compromising efficacy should be sought.

TI  - Fraternal Twins: The Enigmatic Role of the Immune System in Alphaherpesvirus
      Pathogenesis and Latency and Its Impacts on Vaccine Efficacy.
LID - 862 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050862 [doi]
AB  - Although the establishment, maintenance and reactivation from alphaherpesvirus
      latency is far from fully understood, some things are now manifestly clear:
      Alphaherpesvirus latency occurs in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and
      control of the process is multifactorial and complex. This includes components of
      the immune system, contributions from non-neuronal cells surrounding neurons in
      ganglia, specialized nucleic acids and modifications to the viral DNA to name
      some of the most important. Efficacious vaccines have been developed to control
      both acute varicella and zoster, the outcome of reactivation, but despite
      considerable effort vaccines for acute herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or
      reactivated lesions have thus far failed to materialize despite considerable
      effort. Given the relevance of the immune system to establish and maintain HSV
      latency, a vaccine designed to tailor the HSV response to maximize the activity
      of components most critical for controlling reactivated infection might limit the
      severity of recurrences and hence reduce viral transmission. In this review, we
      discuss the current understanding of immunological factors that contribute to HSV
      and VZV latency, identify differences between varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and
      HSV that could explain why vaccines have been valuable at controlling VZV disease
      but not HSV, and finish by outlining possible strategies for developing effective
      HSV vaccines.

      and Future Perspectives.
LID - 848 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050848 [doi]
AB  - Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection causes varicella, which remains a 
      prominent public health concern in children. Current varicella vaccines adopt the
      live-attenuated Oka strain, vOka, which retains the ability to infect neurons,
      establish latency and reactivate, leading to vaccine-associated zoster in some
      vaccinees. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a safer next-generation
      varicella vaccine to help reduce vaccine hesitancy. This paper reviews the
      discovery and identification of the skin- and neuro-tropic factor, the open
      reading frame 7 (ORF7) of VZV, as well as the development of a skin- and
      neuro-attenuated live varicella vaccine comprising an ORF7-deficient mutant, v7D.
      This work could provide insights into the research of novel virus vaccines based 
      on functional genomics and reverse genetics.

      Genomes.
LID - 844 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050844 [doi]
AB  - Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and simian varicella virus (SVV) cause varicella
      (chickenpox) in children and nonhuman primates, respectively. After resolution of
      acute disease, the viruses establish latent infection in neural ganglia, after
      which they may reactivate to cause a secondary disease, such as herpes zoster.
      SVV infection of nonhuman primates provides a model to investigate VZV
      pathogenesis and antiviral strategies. The VZV and SVV genomes are similar in
      size and structure and share 70-75% DNA homology. SVV and VZV DNAs are co-linear 
      in gene arrangement with the exception of the left end of the viral genomes.
      Viral gene expression is regulated into immediate early, early, and late
      transcription during in vitro and in vivo infection. During viral latency, VZV
      and SVV gene expression is limited to transcription of a viral latency-associated
      transcript (VLT). VZV and SVV are closely related alphaherpesviruses that likely 
      arose from an ancestral varicella virus that evolved through cospeciation into
      species-specific viruses.

TI  - Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Enhanced the Synergistic Adjuvant Effect of CpG
      ODNs and QS21 in a Varicella Zoster Virus Glycoprotein E Subunit Vaccine.
LID - 973 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14050973 [doi]
AB  - Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes two diseases: varicella upon primary
      infection and herpes zoster when latent viruses in the sensory ganglia
      reactivate. While varicella vaccines depend on humoral immunity to prevent VZV
      infection, cell-mediated immunity (CMI), which plays a therapeutic role in the
      control or elimination of reactivated VZV in infected cells, is decisive for
      zoster vaccine efficacy. As one of the most abundant glycoproteins of VZV,
      conserved glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for viral replication and transmission
      between ganglion cells, thus making it an ideal target subunit vaccine antigen;
      gE has been successfully used in the herpes zoster vaccine Shingrix(TM) on the
      market. In this report, we found that ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as vectors for coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines could enhance the synergistic adjuvant
      effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and QS21 on VZV-gE, affecting both
      humoral immunity and CMI. Vaccines made with these LNPs showed promise as
      varicella vaccines without a potential risk of herpes zoster, which identifies
      them as a novel type of herpes zoster vaccine similar to Shingrix(TM). All of the
      components in this LNP-CpG-QS21 adjuvant system were proven to be safe after mass
      vaccination, and the high proportion of cholesterol contained in the LNPs was
      helpful for limiting the cytotoxicity induced by QS21, which may lead to the
      development of a novel herpes zoster subunit vaccine for clinical application.

TI  - Health Status of Mytilus chilensis from Intensive Culture Areas in Chile Assessed
      by Molecular, Microbiological, and Histological Analyses.
LID - 494 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11050494 [doi]
AB  - Shellfish farming is a relevant economic activity in Chile, where the inner sea
      in Chiloe island concentrates 99% of the production of the mussel Mytilus
      chilensis. This area is characterized by the presence of numerous human
      activities, which could harm the quality of seawater. Additionally, the presence 
      of potentially pathogenic microorganisms can influence the health status of
      mussels, which must be constantly monitored. To have a clear viewpoint of the
      health status of M. chilensis and to study its potential as a host species for
      exotic diseases, microbiological, molecular, and histological analyses were
      performed. This study was carried out in October 2018, where M. chilensis gut
      were studied for: presence of food-borne bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
      Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), exotic bacteria ("Candidatus Xenohaliotis
      californiensis"), viruses (abalone and Ostreid herpes virus), and protozoa
      (Marteilia spp., Perkinsus spp. and Bonamia spp.). Additionally, 18S rDNA
      metabarcoding and histology analyses were included to have a complete evaluation 
      of the health status of M. chilensis. Overall, despite the presence of risk
      factors, abnormal mortality rates were not reported during the monitoring period 
      and the histological examination did not reveal significant lesions. Pathogens of
      mandatory notification to World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the
      Chilean National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (SERNAPESCA) were not
      detected, which confirms that M. chilensis have a good health status,
      highlighting the importance of an integrated vision of different disciplines to
      ensure the sustainability of this important mussel industry in Chile.

TI  - Comparison of Temperature and Pain Changes between the Drip and Topical Methods
      of Administering the Transnasal Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block.
LID - 830 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm12050830 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare facial temperatures and the visual
      analogue scale (VAS) between the drip method and the topical method of transnasal
      sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB). The transnasal SPGB is administered to
      patients with facial or head and neck pain. In the transnasal approach, the drip 
      and topical methods are frequently used. We compared facial temperatures and VAS 
      after transnasal SPGB. Medical records of 74 patients who visited the pain clinic
      and underwent transnasal SPGB were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 156
      transnasal SPGB were performed. The patients were divided into the drip-method
      and topical-method groups. Facial temperatures were measured in six areas of the 
      right and left forehead, maxilla, and mandible before and 30 min after completion
      of the transnasal SPGB. Temperatures were compared before and 30 min after SPGB
      in each group and between the two groups. VAS scores were compared at the same
      times of SPGB in each group and between the two groups. In the drip-method group,
      there were significant increases at four areas of the face in temperature changes
      at 30 min after SPGB. In the topical-method group, there was no significant
      difference in the temperature changes at 30 min after SPGB. There were
      statistically significant differences in the facial temperature changes between
      the two groups in the right forehead (p = 0.001), left forehead (p = 0.015), and 
      right maxillary area (p = 0.046). In herpes zoster, there were statistically
      significant differences in the VAS scores between before and 30 min after SPGB in
      both groups (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.008) and between two groups (p &lt; 0.001). In
      migraine, there were statistically significant differences in VAS scores between 
      before and 30 min after SPGB in both groups (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004) and between
      two groups (p = 0.014). Transnasal SPGB using two methods showed different
      temperature changes and VAS scores.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to Estimate the Incidence of Infectious Disease Cases
      for Routinely Collected Ambulatory Records: The Example of Varicella-Zoster.
LID - 5959 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19105959 [doi]
AB  - The burden of infectious diseases is crucial for both epidemiological
      surveillance and prompt public health response. A variety of data, including
      textual sources, can be fruitfully exploited. Dealing with unstructured data
      necessitates the use of methods for automatic data-driven variable construction
      and machine learning techniques (MLT) show promising results. In this framework, 
      varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection was chosen to perform an automatic case
      identification with MLT. Pedianet, an Italian pediatric primary care database,
      was used to train a series of models to identify whether a child was diagnosed
      with VZV infection between 2004 and 2014 in the Veneto region, starting from free
      text fields. Given the nature of the task, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with 
      bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) was chosen; the same models were then 
      used to predict the children's status for the following years. A gold standard
      produced by manual extraction for the same interval was available for comparison.
      RNN-GRU improved its performance over time, reaching the maximum value of area
      under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 95.30% at the end of the period. The absolute
      bias in estimates of VZV infection was below 1.5% in the last five years
      analyzed. The findings in this study could assist the large-scale use of EHRs for
      clinical outcome predictive modeling and help establish high-performance systems 
      in other medical domains.

TI  - Orobanche crenata Forssk. Extract Affects Human Breast Cancer Cell MCF-7 Survival
      and Viral Replication.
LID - 1696 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11101696 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of death worldwide. The
      severity of BC strictly depends on the molecular subtype. The less aggressive
      hormone-positive subtype is treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), which 
      causes both physical and psychological side effects. This condition strongly
      impacts the adherence and persistence of AET among oncologic patients. Moreover, 
      viral infections also constitute a serious problem for public health. Despite
      their efficacy, antiviral agents present several therapeutic limits. Accordingly,
      in the present work, we investigated the antitumor and antiviral activities of
      Orobanche crenata Forssk. (O. crenata), a parasitic plant, endemic to the
      Mediterranean basin, traditionally known for its beneficial properties for human 
      health. METHODS: The MTT assay was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxic effect
      of O. crenata leaf extract (OCLE) on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and
      MDA-MB-231) and the primary HFF-1 cell line. The lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) assay
      was performed on MCF-7 cells to analyze necrotic cell death. The antioxidant
      effect of OCLE was evaluated by intracellular determination of the reactive
      oxygen species and thiol groups, by DPPH and ABTS assays. The antiviral activity 
      of OCLE was determined against Poliovirus 1, Echovirus 9, Human respiratory
      syncytial virus, Adenovirus type 2 and type 5, Coxsackievirus B1 (CoxB1) and B3
      (CoxB3), Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), and beta-Coronavirus
      by the plaque reduction assay. RESULTS: The extract, after 24 h of incubation,
      did not affect MDA-MB-231 and HFF-1 cell viability. However, at the same time
      point, it showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells, with an
      increase in LDH release. OCLE exhibited free radical scavenging activity and
      significantly increased non-protein thiol levels in MCF-7 cells. OCLE effectively
      inhibited HSV-1, HSV-2, CoxB1, and CoxB3 replication. CONCLUSIONS: The overall
      results showed an interesting inhibitory effect of OCLE on both MCF-7 cell
      survival and viral replication.

TI  - Kaposi Sarcoma, a Trifecta of Pathogenic Mechanisms.
LID - 1242 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12051242 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma is a rare disease with four known variants: classic, epidemic,
      endemic and iatrogenic (transplant-related), all caused by an oncogenic virus
      named Human Herpes Virus 8. The viral infection in itself, along with the
      oncogenic properties of HHV8 and with immune system dysfunction, forms the
      grounds on which Kaposi's Sarcoma may develop. Infection with HHV8 occurs through
      saliva via close contacts, blood, blood products, solid organ donation and,
      rarely, vertical transmission. Chronic inflammation and oncogenesis are promoted 
      by a mix of viral genes that directly promote cell survival and transformation or
      interfere with the regular cell cycle and cell signaling (of particular note:
      LANA-1, v-IL6, vBCL-2, vIAP, vIRF3, vGPCR, gB, K1, K8.1, K15). The most common
      development sites for Kaposi's sarcoma are the skin, mucocutaneous zones, lymph
      nodes and visceral organs, but it can also rarely appear in the musculoskeletal
      system, urinary system, endocrine organs, heart or eye. Histopathologically,
      spindle cell proliferation with slit-like vascular spaces, plasma cell and
      lymphocyte infiltrate are characteristic. The clinical presentation is
      heterogenic depending on the variant; some patients have indolent disease and
      others have aggressive disease. The treatment options include highly active
      antiretroviral therapy, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
      immunotherapy. A literature search was carried out using the MEDLINE/PubMed,
      SCOPUS and Google Scholar databases with a combination of keywords with the aim
      to provide critical, concise, and comprehensive insights into advances in the
      pathogenic mechanism of Kaposi's sarcoma.

TI  - Presence of Protease Inhibitor 9 and Granzyme B in Healthy and Pathological Human
      Corneas.
LID - 793 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11050793 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to find out whether protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9) and
      granzyme B (GrB) molecules that contribute to immune response and the
      immunological privilege of various tissues are expressed in healthy and
      pathological human corneas. Using cryosections, cell imprints of control
      corneoscleral discs, we showed that PI-9 was expressed particularly in the
      endothelium, the superficial and suprabasal epithelium of healthy corneas,
      limbus, and conjunctiva. GrB was localized in healthy corneal and conjunctival
      epithelium, while the endothelium showed weak immunostaining. The expression of
      PI-6 and GrB was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Increased expression levels of the PI-9
      and GrB genes were determined when the corneas were cultured with proinflammatory
      cytokines. Fluorescent and enzymatic immunohistochemistry of pathological corneal
      explants (corneal melting and herpes virus keratitis) showed pronounced PI-9,
      GrB, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, and leukocyte-common antigen (CD45)
      signals localized in multicellular stromal infiltrates and inflammatory cells
      scattered in the corneal stroma. We conclude that increased expression of the
      PI-9 and GrB proteins under pathological conditions and their upregulation in an 
      inflammatory environment indicate their participation in immune response of the
      cornea during the inflammatory process.

LID - 10.3390/brainsci12050584 [doi]
AB  - Neurological autoimmune diseases have various origins and pathogeneses. Specific 
      antibodies are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, other infectious agents,
      or inherited disorders. We aim to evaluate the relation between the
      autoantibodies, the chosen symptoms, demographic characteristics, and infection
      history. We retrospectively analysed 508 children during neurological
      diagnostics. We investigated serum antineuronal, IgG, IgM anti-ganglioside, and
      anti-aquaporin-4 in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-cell
      surface and anti-synaptic protein antibodies in 463, 99, 44, 343, and 119
      patients, respectively. The CSF polymerase chain reaction detection of
      Herpesviridae, enterovirus, B19 parvovirus, adenovirus, and parechovirus involved
      261 patients. We included available clinical information and
      electroencephalographic, radiologic, and microbiological results. The IgM
      anti-ganglioside antibodies increased the risk of tics and positive symptoms (p =
      0.0345, p = 0.0263, respectively), the anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase particle 
      of paresis (p = 0.0074), and anti-neuroendothelium of mutism (p = 0.0361).
      Anti-neuroendothelium, IgM anti-ganglioside, and CSF anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate
      antibodies were more often associated with consciousness loss (p = 0.0496, p =
      0.0044, p = 0.0463, respectively). Anti-myelin antibodies co-occured with Herpes 
      simplex virus (HSV)-2 IgG (p = 0.0415), anti-CV2 with HSV-1 IgM (p = 0.0394),
      whereas anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein was linked with past Epstein-Barr
      virus infection. The anti-ganglioside IgM and anti-myelin particles were
      bilaterally correlated (p = 0.0472). The clinical pictures may overlap, requiring
      specialistic diagnostics. We noticed the links between the infection aetiology
      and the specific autoantibody's positivity.

AB  - Herpes Zoster is a viral infection that occurs due to reactivation of the
      Varicella Zoster virus. A vaccine has been approved for adults aged 50 and above 
      for the prevention of Herpes Zoster and its complications. This study aims to
      assess the at-risk population's awareness of the disease and its vaccine, and
      attitudes and practices toward the vaccine. A quantitative, observational,
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 adults above the age of 50.
      Non-probability, convenience sampling was used to select participants from public
      venues. SPSS-25 was used to analyze the data. 64.3% (n = 270) of participants
      heard of Herpes Zoster. 78.3% (n = 329) did not recognize the link between
      chickenpox and Herpes Zoster. Multiple linear regression showed that being
      female, Arab expatriate, or healthcare professional were the only positive
      predictors of Herpes Zoster knowledge. 14.8% (n = 62) heard of Herpes Zoster
      vaccine but 96.7% (n = 406) had not taken it. Participants with chronic diseases 
      were 2.064 times more likely to hear about the vaccine than healthy participants 
      (p = 0.026). Multiple linear regression showed that being a healthcare
      professional was the only significant predictor of Herpes Zoster vaccine
      knowledge. 28.1% (n = 118) were not willing to take optional vaccines. Those
      reluctant to take optional vaccines were 26.023 times more likely to take them if
      recommended by a healthcare professional (p < 0.001). Attitudes toward Herpes
      Zoster vaccine were generally positive; however, due to lack of knowledge, poor
      practices were observed. Nationwide campaigns aimed toward at-risk groups can
      raise awareness on Herpes Zoster and its vaccine, subsequently improving Herpes
      Zoster vaccination rate.

AB  - Oral manifestations occur at all stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection. Their clinical expressions and severity depend on the evolution of the
      infection and become critical at the stage of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS).
      They are essentially infectious, tumoral, and, starting a few years ago,
      iatrogenic. Infections are mostly fungal (candidiasis), viral (herpes, zoster,
      human papillomavirus infections, etc.), and less frequently bacterial
      (streptococcemia). Cases of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly syphilis,
      are multiplying preoccupyingly. The most frequently observed tumors are Kaposi's 
      sarcoma. Drug intolerance is common; the symptoms are mostly dermatological, but 
      also oral (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) when
      sulfonamides and certain antiretrovirals are used. The advent of prolonged Highly
      Active Anti-Retroviral Therapies (HAARTs) has led to a decline in the incidence
      of most opportunistic conditions, infections and tumors (except for multiple oral
      warts and zoster). HAARTs also provoke adverse reactions such as lipodystrophy
      syndromes (signs of peripheral atrophy and central hypertrophy, associated in
      varying degrees with metabolic syndromes). Extended survival and the new methods 
      for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections have gradually modified diagnostic
      and therapeutic strategies for oral manifestations of HIV infections.

AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a human oncovirus. KSHV relies
      on manipulating the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway 
      to enhance virus replication. Methylation within a RNA stem loop of the open
      reading frame 50 (ORF50) increases transcript stability via the recruitment of
      the m6A reader, SND1. In this contribution we explore the energy landscapes of
      the unmethylated and methylated RNA stem loops of ORF50 to investigate the effect
      of methylation on the structure of the stem loop. We observe a significant shift 
      upon methylation between an open and closed configuration of the top of the stem 
      loop. In the unmethylated stem loop the closed configuration is much lower in
      energy, and, as a result, exhibits higher occupancy.

TI  - Prevalence of and risk factors associated with HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus-type 2, 
      Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections among 18-24 year old
      students attending Higher Learning Institutions in Mbeya-Tanzania.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common among young people 
      in low- and middle-income countries and are associated with negative reproductive
      and pregnancy outcomes. Most of the studies have assessed HIV among adolescents
      and young adults, with limited information on occurrence of other STIs in this
      population. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of and risk factors
      associated with Herpes Simplex Virus-type 2 (HSV-2), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), 
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Syphilis and HIV infection among young adults
      attending Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs) in Mbeya, Tanzania. METHODS: We
      conducted a cross-sectional study among students aged 18-24years attending HLIs
      in Mbeya-Tanzania, randomly selected using a computerized random number.
      Participants were tested for HSV-2, CT, NG, Syphilis and HIV infection. We used a
      self-administered questionnaire to collect information on sexual activity and
      risk factors to the tested STIs. RESULTS: We enrolled 504 students from 5 HLIs,
      with mean age of 21.5 years (SD 1.7). 17% of the students had at least one STI;
      prevalence was higher among females than males (21.1% versus 14.1%). CT (11%) and
      HSV-2 (6.1%) were the most common STIs, while NG (1.1%) and HIV (0.7%) infection 
      had the least occurrence. None of the participants was diagnosed with Syphilis.
      In univariate analysis, predictors for STIs were Sex, inconsistent condom use in 
      the past 4weeks, report of oral sex, sexual orientation (bisexual/homosexual) and
      having a sexual partner with an age-difference of at least 5years (either older
      or younger); while in the multivariate analysis, Sex, inconsistent condom use in 
      the past 4weeks and sexual orientation (bisexual/homosexual) remained
      significant. CONCLUSION: STIs such as Chlamydia and HSV-2 which are commonly
      asymptomatic are of concern among young adults attending HLIs. The latter is an
      important group that needs attention and recognition that is pivotal in
      transmission of STIs considering their risk. Information, Education and
      Communication (IEC) campaigns targeting young adults, especially those at HLIs,
      need to focus on exposure-risk minimization. Funding institutions that have
      invested heavily on HIV prevention campaigns should consider giving similar
      recognition to other STIs for a streamlined outcome.

TI  - Combination of Preoperative Multimodal Image Fusion and Intraoperative Dyna CT in
      Percutaneous Balloon Compression of Trigeminal Ganglion for Primary Trigeminal
      Neuralgia: Experience in 24 Patients.
PG  - 895394
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.895394 [doi]
AB  - Objective: We retrospectively assessed the surgical results of PBC with
      preoperative multimodal image fusion and intraoperative Dyna Computed Tomography 
      (CT) in 24 patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia (PTN) to explore a valuable
      aid for Percutaneous balloon compression (PBC). Methods: We studied the data of
      24 patients with PTN. All patients underwent PBC and were assessed with
      preoperative multimodal image fusion [computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)] and intraoperative Dyna CT in the Department of
      Neurosurgery of Zhuhai People's Hospital between October 2020 and September 2021.
      Multimodal image fusion-three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CT and MRI
      data-was performed using 3D-Slicer software, and preoperative evaluation was
      performed according to the results of image fusion. Dyna CT was used to
      dynamically observe the position and shape of the metallic hollow introducer and 
      Fogarty catheter and balloon during the operation to guide the operation in real 
      time. We performed follow-up assessments each month and summarized the clinical
      characteristics, surgical effects, and complications in all patients. Results:
      Surgery was successful for all patients; the patients reported immediate pain
      relief. Surgical complications included facial numbness in 24 patients (100%),
      mild masseter weakness in three (12.5%), herpes zoster in three (12.5%), and
      balloon rupture in one (4.2%). None of the patients had serious surgical
      complications. The mean follow-up time was 9.6 +/- 2.7 months. During the
      follow-up period, 22 patients (91.7%) experienced no recurrence of pain, and two 
      patients (8.3%) experienced recurrence of pain, of which one underwent secondary 
      PBC surgery. Conclusions: Preoperative multimodal image reconstruction can help
      fully evaluate PBC surgery, clarify the etiology, and predict the volume of
      contrast medium required during the operation. It provided important assistance
      for PBC treatment of trigeminal neuralgia patients when preoperative multimodal
      image fusion is combined with intraoperative Dyna CT.

AB  - Malignant soft tissue tumors, particularly highly malignant leiomyosarcomas, are 
      resistant to chemotherapy and associated with a poor prognosis. T-01, a
      third-generation genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1, replicates in 
      tumor cells alone and exerts a cell-killing effect. The current study aimed to
      investigate the antitumor effect of T-01, which is a novel treatment for
      leiomyosarcoma. In vitro, six human cell lines and one mouse sarcoma cell line
      were assessed for T-01 cytotoxicity. In vivo, the efficacy of T-01 was examined
      in subcutaneously transplanted leiomyosarcoma (SK-LMS-1) cells and subcutaneously
      or intraperitoneally transplanted mouse sarcoma (CCRF S-180II) cells. Cytokines
      were assessed using ELISpot assay with splenocytes from the allogeneic models for
      immunological evaluation. T-01 showed cytotoxicity in all seven cell lines (p <
      0.001). In the SK-LMS-1 xenotransplantation model, tumor growth was suppressed by
      T-01 administration (p = 0.02). In the CCRF S-180II subcutaneous tumor model,
      bilateral tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the T-01-treated group
      compared with the control group (p < 0.001). In the peritoneal dissemination
      model, T-01 treatment caused significant survival prolongation compared with the 
      control (p < 0.01). In conclusion, third-generation genetically modified herpes
      simplex virus type 1 may be an effective novel therapy against refractory
      sarcomas.

AB  - The eye is considered immune privileged such that immune responses are dampened
      to protect vision. As the most anterior compartment of the eye, the cornea is
      exposed to pathogens and can mount immune responses that recruit effector T
      cells. However, presence of immune memory in the cornea is not defined. Here, we 
      use intravital 2-photon microscopy to examine T cell responses in the cornea in
      mice. We show that recruitment of CD8(+) T cells in response to ocular virus
      infection results in the formation of tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells.
      Motile corneal TRM cells patrol the cornea and rapidly respond in situ to antigen
      rechallenge. CD103(+) TRM cell generation requires antigen and transforming
      growth factor beta. In vivo imaging in humans also reveals highly motile cells
      that patrol the healthy cornea. Our study finds that TRM cells form in the cornea
      where they can provide local protective immunity.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the comparative efficacy of ganciclovir ophthalmic gel and 
      famciclovir oral tablets in cats with experimentally induced ocular feline
      herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) epithelial infection. Methods: A randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial was performed using 16 nonvaccinated, specific
      pathogen-free cats with experimental FHV-1 infection induced by topical ocular
      inoculation. Cats received topical ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel (1 drop 3
      times daily, n = 6 cats), oral famciclovir (90 mg/kg twice daily, n = 6), or
      topical artificial tear gel (1 drop 3 times daily, n = 4) for 14 days. Cats were 
      monitored after inoculation for 30 days. Ophthalmic examinations were performed
      every 2 days and ocular disease scores calculated. In vivo confocal microscopy
      was performed, and corneal leukocyte infiltrates quantified. Ocular samples for
      FHV-1 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and virus isolation assays
      were collected every 3 days. Hemograms and serum biochemistry panels were
      performed at intervals. Results: Clinical ocular disease scores and corneal
      leukocyte infiltrates were significantly lower in the ganciclovir and famciclovir
      groups compared with placebo, but no significant differences were detected
      between the antiviral treatment groups. Ocular viral loads determined by qPCR
      were significantly lower in the ganciclovir group compared with the placebo
      group, but there were no significant differences between the other study groups. 
      Hemograms and biochemistry panels were unremarkable. Conclusion: Topical
      application of ganciclovir gel 3 times daily was well-tolerated and displayed
      similar efficacy at reducing clinical ocular disease scores and corneal
      inflammation as twice daily oral famciclovir treatment in cats with experimental 
      ocular FHV-1 infection.

TI  - CMV seropositivity is a potential novel risk factor for severe COVID-19 in
      non-geriatric patients.
PG  - e0268530
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has so far affected more than 250 million individuals
      worldwide, causing more than 5 million deaths. Several risk factors for severe
      disease have been identified, most of which coincide with advanced age. In
      younger individuals, severe COVID-19 often occurs in the absence of obvious
      comorbidities. Guided by the finding of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells
      with some cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) 
      patient, we decided to investigate whether CMV seropositivity is associated with 
      severe or critical COVID-19. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) serostatus was
      investigated as control. METHODS: National German COVID-19 bio-sample and data
      banks were used to retrospectively analyze the CMV and HSV serostatus of patients
      who experienced mild (n = 101), moderate (n = 130) or severe to critical (n = 80)
      disease by IgG serology. We then investigated the relationship between disease
      severity and herpesvirus serostatus via statistical models. RESULTS:
      Non-geriatric patients (< 60 years) with severe COVID-19 were found to have a
      very high prevalence of CMV-seropositivity, while CMV status distribution in
      individuals with mild disease was similar to the prevalence in the German
      population; interestingly, this was not detectable in older patients. Prediction 
      models support the hypothesis that the CMV serostatus, unlike HSV, might be a
      strong biomarker in identifying younger individuals with a higher risk of
      developing severe COVID-19, in particular in absence of other co-morbidities.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified 'CMV-seropositivity' as a potential novel risk factor 
      for severe COVID-19 in non-geriatric individuals in the studied cohorts. More
      mechanistic analyses as well as confirmation of similar findings in cohorts
      representing the currently most relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants should be performed 
      shortly.

TI  - Herpesviruses in Periodontitis: An Umbrella Review.
PG  - 139-155
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-96881-6_7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous studies indicating a high prevalence of
      herpesviruses in both apical and marginal periodontitis samples, their exact role
      in the pathogenesis of a periodontal disease is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: This
      umbrella review aimed to summarize data on herpesviruses detection in marginal
      periodontitis (MP) and apical periodontitis of endodontic origin (APEO) samples. 
      METHODS: The study protocol has been drafted a priori and registered to the
      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
      (CRD42020215922). The literature search was conducted using the following
      electronic databases: Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from inception to October 2020, with no 
      language restrictions. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis that
      evaluated the association between the occurrence of herpesviruses and different
      forms of periodontal diseases were included. Other types of studies, including
      narrative reviews, were excluded. Two reviewers independently performed a
      literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment of included studies.
      Any disagreements or doubts were resolved by a third reviewer. The quality of the
      reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool (A measurement tool to assess
      systematic reviews). RESULTS: Six systematic reviews were included in the current
      review. One was graded as high quality, another one was graded as moderate
      quality, whereas the other four were graded as critically low-quality reviews.
      The presence of herpesviruses in subgingival samples was associated with an
      increased risk of MP, supported by the corresponding meta-analyses. Although the 
      association was strong (OR > 3.0), the confidence intervals were wide,
      heterogeneity was significant, and studies were of small sample size. In
      addition, publication bias was detected. Contrary, data from systematic reviews
      that assessed APEO and herpesviruses did not show any significant associations.
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality studies with high uncertainty suggest a strong
      association between herpesviruses and MP, but not with APEO.

TI  - Oncolytic viral vectors in the era of diversified cancer therapy: from
      preclinical to clinical.
PG  - 1682-1701

AB  - With the in-depth research and wide application of immunotherapy recently, new
      therapies based on oncolytic viruses are expected to create new prospects for
      cancer treatment via eliminating the suppression of the immune system by tumors. 
      Currently, an increasing number of viruses are developed and engineered, and
      various virus vectors based on effectively stimulating human immune system to
      kill tumor cells have been approved for clinical treatment. Although the virus
      can retard the proliferation of tumor cells, the choice of oncolytic viruses in
      biological cancer therapy is equally critical given their therapeutic efficacy,
      safety and adverse effects. Moreover, previously known oncolytic viruses have not
      been systematically classified. Therefore, in this review, we summarized and
      distinguished the characteristics of several common types of oncolytic viruses:
      herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, measles virus, Newcastle disease virus,
      reovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Subsequently, we outlined that these
      oncolytic viral vectors have been transformed from preclinical studies in
      combination with immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and nanoparticles
      into clinical therapeutic strategies for various advanced solid malignancies or
      circulatory system cancers.

AB  - The article gives the clinical case of herpes simplex encephalitis relapse with
      the resistant seizures in a child. What we describe is a clinical approach
      towards the differential diagnostic of the seizures in structural epilepsy, which
      are resistant to anticonvulsants, or late herpes simplex encephalitis relapse.
      Good clinical perspective may be the indication of the intratecal synthesis of
      the IgG-specific antibodies to the herpes simplex type 1 and 2. Conducting
      etiotropic treatment with the appointment of acyclovir and pathogenetic therapy
      with the use of Cytoflavin contributed to the rapid and stable remission of
      epileptic seizures and regression of neurological deficit.

      Agents for Ultrasound Imaging and Inhibited the Growth of ErbB2-Overexpressing
      Gastric Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1515-1530
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S351623 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world.
      However, the current research on the diagnosis and treatment of nano-ultrasound
      contrast agents in the field of tumor is mostly focused on breast cancer, ovarian
      cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, etc. Due to the interference of gas in the
      stomach, there is no report on the treatment of gastric cancer. Herpes simplex
      virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) therapy system is the most mature
      tumor suicide gene in cancer treatment. At the same time, in order to improve its
      safety and efficiency, we designed a gastric tumor targeted ultrasound-triggered 
      phase-transition nano ultrasound contrast agent PFH/AGM-CBA/HSV-TK/Liposome
      (PAHL)-Affibody complex. Methods: In our study, guanidinylated SS-PAAs polymer
      poly(agmatine/N, N'-cystamine-bis-acrylamide) (AGM-CBA) was used as a nuclear
      localization vector of suicide gene to form a polyplex, perfluorohexane (PFH) was
      used as ultrasound contrast agent, liposomes were used to encapsulate
      perfluorohexane droplets and the polyplexes of AGM-CBA/HSV-TK, and affibody
      molecules were conjugated to the prepared PAHL in order to obtain a specific
      targeting affinity to human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (ErbB2) at
      gastric cancer cells. With the aid of ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction
      technology and the nuclear localization effect of AGM-CBA vector, the
      transfection efficiency of the suicide gene in gastric cancer cells was
      significantly increased, leading to significant apoptosis of gastric cancer
      cells. Results: It was shown that PAHL-Affibody complex was nearly spherical with
      an average diameter of 560 +/- 28.9 nm, having higher and specific affinity to
      ErbB2 (+) gastric cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that PAHL could
      target gastric cancer cells expressing ErbB2. In a contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      scanning study, the prepared ultrasound-triggered phase-change nano-ultrasound
      contrast agent, PAHL, showed improved ultrasound enhancement effects. With the
      application of the low-frequency ultrasound, the gene transfection efficiency of 
      PAHL was significantly improved, thereby inducing significant apoptosis in
      gastric cancer cells. Conclusion: This study constructs
      PFH/AGM-CBA/HSV-TK/Liposome-Affibody nano ultrasound contrast agent, which
      provides new ideas for the treatment strategy of ErbB2-positive gastric cancer
      and provides some preliminary experimental basis for its inhibitory effect.

TI  - Infectious keratitis: A review.
PG  - 543-562

AB  - Globally, infectious keratitis is the fifth leading cause of blindness. The main 
      predisposing factors include contact lens wear, ocular injury and ocular surface 
      disease. Staphylococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusarium species,
      Candida species and Acanthamoeba species are the most common causal organisms.
      Culture of corneal scrapes is the preferred initial test to identify the culprit 
      organism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and in vivo confocal microscopy
      can complement the diagnosis. Empiric therapy is typically commenced with
      fluoroquinolones, or fortified antibiotics for bacterial keratitis; topical
      natamycin for fungal keratitis; and polyhexamethylene biguanide or chlorhexidine 
      for acanthamoeba keratitis. Herpes simplex keratitis is mainly diagnosed
      clinically; however, PCR can also be used to confirm the initial diagnosis and in
      atypical cases. Antivirals and topical corticosteroids are indicated depending on
      the corneal layer infected. Vision impairment, blindness and even loss of the eye
      can occur with a delay in diagnosis and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy.

TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial, cytotoxicity, and antiviral impact of a green zinc
      oxide/activated carbon nanocomposite.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12648-w [doi]
AB  - This work deals with the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles/activated carbon
      (ZnO NPs/AC) nanocomposites with different weight ratios (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3),
      where the antimicrobial, antiviral, and cytotoxicity impact of the formulated
      nanocomposites were evaluated versus the crude ZnO and AC samples. The formula
      (3:1; designated Z3C1) exhibited the utmost bactericidal effect against Gram
      positive group, unicellular and filamentous fungi. Regarding Gram negative group,
      the sample (Z3C1) was remarkably effective against Klebsiella pneumonia, unlike
      the case of Escherichia coli. Moreover, the whole samples showed negligible
      cytotoxicity against the human WI38 cell line, where the most brutality (4%) was 
      exerted by 1000 microg/mL of the formula (Z1C3). Whilst, the formula (Z3C1)
      exerted the apical inhibition impact against Herpes simplex (HSV1) virus.
      Consequently, the synthesized (Z3C1) nanocomposite was sorted out to be fully
      characterized via different physicochemical techniques including FTIR, XRD, SEM, 
      TEM, Zeta potential, TGA, and BET. XRD indicated a predominance of the
      crystalline pattern of ZnO NPs over the amorphous AC, while the FTIR chart
      confirmed an immense combination between the ZnO NPs and AC. SEM, TEM, and size
      distribution images illustrated that the fabricated ZnO NPs/AC was in the
      nanoscale size swung from 30 to 70 nm. The distinctive surface area of composite 
      material, recording 66.27 m(2)/g, clearly disclosed its bioactivity toward
      different bacterial, fungal, and virus species.

TI  - Peripheral Blood Microbiome Analysis via Noninvasive Prenatal Testing Reveals the
      Complexity of Circulating Microbial Cell-Free DNA.
PG  - e0041422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00414-22 [doi]
AB  - While circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is becoming a powerful marker for
      noninvasive identification of infectious pathogens in liquid biopsy specimens, a 
      microbial cfDNA baseline in healthy individuals is urgently needed for the proper
      interpretation of microbial cfDNA sequencing results in clinical metagenomics.
      Because noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) shares many similarities with the
      sequencing protocol of metagenomics, we utilized the standard low-pass
      whole-genome-sequencing-based NIPT to establish a microbial cfDNA baseline in
      healthy people. Sequencing data from a total of 107,763 peripheral blood samples 
      of healthy pregnant women undergoing NIPT screening were retrospectively
      collected and reanalyzed for microbiome DNA screening. It was found that more
      than 95% of exogenous cfDNA was from bacteria, 3% from eukaryotes, and 0.4% from 
      viruses, indicating the gut/environment origins of many microorganisms. Overall
      and regional abundance patterns were well illustrated, with huge regional
      diversity and complexity, and unique interspecies and symbiotic relationships
      were observed for TORCH organisms (Toxoplasma gondii, others [Treponema pallidum 
      {causing syphilis}, hepatitis B virus {HBV}, and human parvovirus B19 {HPV-B19}],
      rubella virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], and herpes simplex virus [HSV]) and another
      common virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). To sum up, our study revealed the
      complexity of the baseline circulating microbial cfDNA and showed that microbial 
      cfDNA sequencing results need to be interpreted in a more comprehensive manner.
      IMPORTANCE While circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been becoming a powerful
      marker for noninvasive identification of infectious pathogens in liquid biopsy
      specimens, a baseline for microbial cfDNA in healthy individuals is urgently
      needed for the proper interpretation of microbial cfDNA sequencing results in
      clinical metagenomics. Standard low-pass whole-genome-sequencing-based NIPT
      shares many similarities with the sequencing protocol for metagenomics and could 
      provide a microbial cfDNA baseline in healthy people; thus, a reference cfDNA
      data set of the human microbiome was established with sequencing data from a
      total of 107,763 peripheral blood samples of healthy pregnant women undergoing
      NIPT screening. Our study revealed the complexity of circulating microbial cfDNA 
      and indicated that microbial cfDNA sequencing results need to be interpreted in a
      more comprehensive manner, especially with regard to geographic patterns and
      coexistence networks.

TI  - DLK-Dependent Biphasic Reactivation of Herpes Simplex Virus Latency Established
      in the Absence of Antivirals.
PG  - e0050822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00508-22 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) latent
      infection and reactivation in neurons requires the use of in vitro model systems.
      Establishing a quiescent infection in cultured neurons is problematic, as any
      infectious virus released can superinfect the cultures. Previous studies have
      used the viral DNA replication inhibitor acyclovir to prevent superinfection and 
      promote latency establishment. Data from these previous models have shown that
      reactivation is biphasic, with an initial phase I expression of all classes of
      lytic genes, which occurs independently of histone demethylase activity and viral
      DNA replication but is dependent on the cell stress protein DLK. Here, we
      describe a new model system using HSV-1 Stayput-GFP, a reporter virus that is
      defective for cell-to-cell spread and establishes latent infections without the
      need for acyclovir. The establishment of a latent state requires a longer time
      frame than previous models using DNA replication inhibitors. This results in a
      decreased ability of the virus to reactivate using established inducers, and as
      such, a combination of reactivation triggers is required. Using this system, we
      demonstrate that biphasic reactivation occurs even when latency is established in
      the absence of acyclovir. Importantly, phase I lytic gene expression still occurs
      in a histone demethylase and viral DNA replication-independent manner and
      requires DLK activity. These data demonstrate that the two waves of viral gene
      expression following HSV-1 reactivation are independent of secondary infection
      and not unique to systems that require acyclovir to promote latency
      establishment. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) enters a latent
      infection in neurons and periodically reactivates. Reactivation manifests as a
      variety of clinical symptoms. Studying latency and reactivation in vitro is
      invaluable, allowing the molecular mechanisms behind both processes to be
      targeted by therapeutics that reduce the clinical consequences. Here, we describe
      a novel in vitro model system using a cell-to-cell spread-defective HSV-1, known 
      as Stayput-GFP, which allows for the study of latency and reactivation at the
      single neuron level. We anticipate this new model system will be an incredibly
      valuable tool for studying the establishment and reactivation of HSV-1 latent
      infection in vitro. Using this model, we find that initial reactivation events
      are dependent on cellular stress kinase DLK but independent of histone
      demethylase activity and viral DNA replication. Our data therefore further
      validate the essential role of DLK in mediating a wave of lytic gene expression
      unique to reactivation.

      and PRISMA guidelines were followed to systematically review, synthesize, and
      report HSV-2-related data up to January 21, 2021. Meta-analyses and
      meta-regressions were performed. RESULTS: In Canada, pooled mean seroprevalence
      was 10.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.8-12.4%) among general populations,
      44.5% (95% CI, 20.0-70.5%) among sexually transmitted infection clinic attendees 
      and symptomatic populations, and 60.7% (95% CI, 49.8-71.1%) among human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and individuals in
      HIV-discordant couples. In Australia and New Zealand, combined, pooled mean
      seroprevalence was 15.4% (95% CI, 9.6-22.2%) among general populations, 27.8%
      (95% CI, 12.0-47.2%) among men who have sex with men, and 37.2% (95% CI,
      23.7-51.8%) among sexually transmitted infection clinic attendees and symptomatic
      populations. Men had 0.64-fold (95% CI, 0.47-0.86) lower seroprevalence compared 
      with women. No evidence was found for a decline in seroprevalence over time.
      Pooled mean proportion of HSV-2 isolation in laboratory-confirmed genital herpes 
      was 62.1% (95% CI, 53.8-70.1%) in Canada and 71.9% (95% CI, 64.2-78.9%) in
      Australia and New Zealand. Proportion of HSV-2 isolation in genital herpes
      declined by 0.98-fold (95% CI, 0.97-0.99) per year. Pooled mean proportion of
      HSV-2 isolation in genital ulcer disease was 17.4% (95% CI, 4.0-37.1%) in these
      countries. CONCLUSIONS: Over 10% of adults in these countries are infected, with 
      no evidence for declining seroprevalence, unlike other global regions. Over 60%
      of genital herpes cases are caused by HSV-2 in these countries, yet HSV-2's role 
      is declining by 2% per year.

TI  - Erythema multiforme associated with anti-plakin antibodies: a multicentric
      retrospective case series.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Erythema multiforme (EM) is a muco-cutaneous inflammatory disease
      mainly triggered by herpes simplex virus (HSV) recurrences. Association of EM and
      circulating auto-antibodies against plakins (anti-PLK-Abs [EM-PLK+]) has been
      reported. However, little is known about this subset of EM. OBJECTIVES: We aimed 
      to describe the clinical and immunological features and response to treatment of 
      EM-PLK+. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentric study of EM-PLK+
      selected from the database of the immunological laboratory of Bichat hospital,
      Paris, France, from January 2009 to December 2020. Anti-PLK-Abs were detected in 
      >/=1 immunological tests: immunofluorescence assay, immunoblotting and/or ELISA. 
      Patients with alternative diagnoses were excluded. RESULTS: We included 29
      patients (16 women, median age 25 [range 2-58] years). EM-PLK+ were mostly major 
      (EM with >/=2 mucosal involvements; n = 24, 83%) and relapsing (>/=2 flares; n = 
      23, 79%). Cutaneous lesions were target (n = 13, 54%) and target-like lesions (n 
      = 9, 38%) with usual topography (acral, n = 19, 79%; limbs, n = 21, 88%). Mucosal
      lesions affected the mouth (n = 27, 96%) and genitalia (n = 19, 68%), with a
      median of 2 [range 0-5] mucous membranes. EM-PLK+ were suspected as certain or
      possible postherpetic (EM-HSV) in 19 cases (65.5%); no triggering factors were
      detected in 9 (31%) patients. Desmoplakin-I/II Abs were the most frequent
      anti-PLK-Abs (n = 20, 69%); envoplakin and periplakin Abs were detected in 11 and
      9 cases. Relapsing EM-PLK+ (n = 23) were still active (>/=1 flare within 6
      months) in 13 (57%) patients despite immunosuppressive therapy (n = 8, 62%).
      Antiviral drugs were ineffective in preventing relapse in 15/16 (94%) EM-HSV.
      CONCLUSION: The rationale for anti-PLK-Ab detection in EM is not elucidated. More
      systematic research of anti-PLK-Abs is warranted to better understand whether
      this association reflects humoral immune activity in a subset of EM or is
      fortuitous, related to an epitope spreading process. However, EM-PLK+ seems to be
      associated with major and relapsing subtypes, and difficult-to-treat cases.

AB  - There are several reports that herpes zoster characterized by reactivation of
      varicella zoster virus (VZV) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      vaccines can occur. Herein, we report VZV meningitis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus 
      (HZO), and late neurotrophic keratitis after receiving a second dose of messenger
      RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine. A 74-year-old man developed a vesicular skin rash on
      the forehead, scalp, nose, and left upper eyelid with a severe headache. Five
      days earlier, he received a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on his left 
      arm. Ocular examination revealed conjunctival hyperemia and pseudodendrite in the
      peripheral cornea. VZV was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid using polymerase
      chain reaction. The patient was diagnosed with HZO and meningitis. The patient
      was treated with intravenous acyclovir and topical acyclovir ointment and
      levofloxacin 1.5% eye drops. One month later, he developed a central epithelial
      defect with a rolled margin, typical of a neurotrophic ulcer. Treatment with a
      therapeutic contact lens and a combination of topical recombinant human
      epithelial growth factor and ofloxacin ointment was initiated. At six months
      after vaccination, the slit-lamp examination findings were stable with a mild
      corneal superficial stromal haze.

TI  - Therapeutic Implications of the Microbial Hypothesis of Mental Illness.
LID - 10.1007/7854_2022_368 [doi]
AB  - There is increasingly compelling evidence that microorganisms may play an
      etiological role in the emergence of mental illness in a subset of the
      population. Historically, most work has focused on the neurotrophic
      herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as the protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. In this
      chapter, we provide an umbrella review of this literature and additionally
      highlight prospective studies that allow more mechanistic conclusions to be
      drawn. Next, we focus on clinical trials of anti-microbial medications for the
      treatment of psychiatric disorders. We critically evaluate six trials that tested
      the impact of anti-herpes medications on inflammatory outcomes in the context of 
      a medical disorder, nine clinical trials utilizing anti-herpetic medications for 
      the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or
      schizophrenia, and four clinical trials utilizing anti-parasitic medications for 
      the treatment of schizophrenia. We then turn our attention to evidence for a gut 
      dysbiosis and altered microbiome in psychiatric disorders, and the potential
      therapeutic effects of probiotics, including an analysis of more than 10
      randomized controlled trials of probiotics in the context of schizophrenia,
      bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD).

AB  - HISTORY: Part one of this case appeared 4 months previously and may contain
      larger images. A 21-year-old immunocompetent man who was a long-term resident of 
      Qatar presented to the emergency department with recurrent episodes of unprovoked
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting 2-3 minutes that spontaneously resolved
      and were associated with postictal confusion. The patient also had progressive
      mild diplopia, intermittent dizziness, and numbness in the left arm over the
      course of 3 months. The patient did not have any other systemic symptoms or
      chronic medical diseases. He did not have any history of intake of illicit drugs,
      supplements, or regular medications; he had not received any recent vaccinations;
      and he had not undergone any surgical procedures. He had no history of travel. At
      presentation, vital signs were normal. Neurologic examination showed mild left
      homonymous hemianopia, normal gait with no cerebellar signs, and preserved
      sensations, power, tone, and reflexes in all four limbs. An electroencephalogram 
      showed no epileptiform discharges. Chest CT and extensive laboratory work-up,
      including viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasite work-up, thyroid function tests,
      and immunologic blood tests yielded normal results. Those included normal
      complete and differential blood counts and normal serum chemistry. Serum analysis
      was negative for antinuclear antibody, Sjogren syndrome antigens A and B,
      cytoplasmic antineutrophil cvtoplasmic antibody, and paraneoplastic profile.
      Serum evaluation was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and
      type 2 RNA, and Brucella, Schistosoma, and toxoplasma antibodies. Venereal
      Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma regain (RPR) test results
      were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid and normal
      pressure and biochemistry, except for elevated protein concentration (0.48 g/L)
      (normal range, 0.15-0.45 g/L). There were 43 leukocytes/microL (99% lymphocytes) 
      (normal range, 0-5 leukocytes/microL; lymphocytes range, 40%-80%), with no
      atypical or malignant cells. CSF Gram staining, acid-fast staining, cryptococcal 
      antigen, varicella-zoster virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), herpes simplex
      virus PCR, VDRL, and RPR test results were negative. CSF cultures did not show
      any evidence of growth of bacteria, fungi, or acid-fast bacillus. CSF flow
      cytometry did not show a monoclonal lymphoid population. No CSF oligoclonal bands
      were detected. Conventional brain MRI with intravenous administration of contrast
      material and perfusion study were performed and included different sequences
      (Figs 1-3).

TI  - Atypical anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with varicella zoster virus
      infection.
LID - 10.1007/s13365-022-01080-5 [doi]
AB  - The triggering effect of herpes simplex virus infection on the development of
      anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is now well established. 
      However, there are very few reports that has linked a varicella zoster virus
      (VZV) reactivation with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. In this report, we describe a
      case of a 57-year-old man presented with atypical clinical presentation of
      anti-NMDAR encephalitis with gait ataxia, complete ophtalmoplegia, and abolished 
      reflexes followed by drowsiness and confusion. Initial diagnosis of Bickerstaff's
      brainstem encephalitis was suspected. Few days later, the patient developed
      herpes zoster in a localized right T1-T2 dermatome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV was negative. CSF anti-NMDA antibodies
      were proved positive. A diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with concomitant VZV
      skin reactivation was retained. Favorable outcome with combined antiviral
      treatment and immunomodulatory therapy was observed. Concomitant VZV reactivation
      with autoimmune encephalitis is possible. Prognosis and therapeutic options in
      this rare condition remain to be clarified.

TI  - Peripheral Neurectomy With Customized Nerve Reconstruction for Periorbital
      Neuropathic Pain: Initial Experience and Clinical Outcomes.
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0000000000002210 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a novel, minimally invasive surgical technique to treat
      severe, intractable periorbital neuropathic pain. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis of patients with severe, treatment-refractory periorbital pain who
      underwent transection of affected sensory trigeminal branches with nerve repair
      was performed. Collected data included etiology and duration of neuropathic pain,
      comorbidities, prior treatment history, surgical technique including site of
      transected sensory nerves and type of nerve repair, preoperative and
      postoperative pain scores as well as follow-up duration. Differences between
      preoperative and postoperative values were analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank
      test. RESULTS: A total of 5 patients with severe periorbital neuropathic pain
      underwent transection of affected supraorbital, supratrochlear, infratrochlear,
      infraorbital, zygomaticotemporal, and zygomaticofacial nerves with customized
      nerve reconstruction. All 5 had improvement of periorbital pain after surgery,
      with 3 (60%) noting complete resolution of pain and 2 (40%) experiencing partial 
      pain relief over a median follow-up period of 9 months (interquartile range
      [IQR], 6-19 months). Of the 3 patients who had complete resolution of pain, all
      reported continued pain relief. Median McGill pain scores significantly decreased
      from 8.4 (IQR, 8.2-10.0) preoperatively to 0.0 (IQR, 0.0-4.8; p < 0.001)
      postoperatively. All patients reported satisfaction with the surgical procedure
      and stated that they would undergo the procedure again if given the option. One
      patient with history of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) had reactivation of herpes
      zoster at postoperative month 3, which was self-limited, without worsening of her
      neuropathic pain. Another patient with PHN required a staged procedure to achieve
      complete pain relief. CONCLUSION: Peripheral neurectomy with customized
      reconstruction of involved sensory nerves can successfully reduce and even
      eradicate periorbital neuropathic pain that was previously recalcitrant to
      combination pharmacotherapy and prior neurolysis procedures.

TI  - Ex Vivo Herpes Simplex Virus Reactivation Involves a Dual Leucine Zipper
      Kinase-Dependent Wave of Lytic Gene Expression That Is Independent of Histone
      Demethylase Activity and Viral Genome Synthesis.
PG  - e0047522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00475-22 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) maintains a lifelong latent infection in neurons
      and periodically reactivates, resulting in the production of infectious virus.
      The exact cellular pathways that induce reactivation are not understood. In
      primary neuronal models of HSV latency, the cellular protein dual leucine zipper 
      kinase (DLK) has been found to initiate a wave of viral gene expression known as 
      phase I. Phase I occurs independently of both viral DNA replication and the
      activities of histone demethylase enzymes required to remove repressive
      heterochromatin modifications associated with the viral genome. In this study, we
      investigated whether phase I-like gene expression occurs in ganglia reactivated
      from infected mice. Using the combined trigger of explant-induced axotomy and
      inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, we found that HSV 
      lytic gene expression was induced rapidly from both sensory and sympathetic
      neurons. Ex vivo reactivation involved a wave of viral late gene expression that 
      occurred independently of viral genome synthesis and histone demethylase activity
      and preceded the detection of infectious virus. Importantly, we found that DLK
      was required for the initial induction of lytic gene expression. These data
      confirm the essential role of DLK in inducing HSV-1 gene expression from the
      heterochromatin-associated genome and further demonstrate that HSV-1 gene
      expression during reactivation occurs via mechanisms that are distinct from lytic
      replication. IMPORTANCE Reactivation of herpes simplex virus from a latent
      infection is associated with clinical disease. To develop new therapeutics that
      prevent reactivation, it is important to understand how viral gene expression
      initiates following a reactivation stimulus. Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is 
      a cellular protein that has previously been found to be required for HSV
      reactivation from sympathetic neurons in vitro. Here, we show that DLK is
      essential for reactivation from sensory ganglia isolated from infected mice.
      Furthermore, we show that DLK-dependent gene expression ex vivo occurs via
      mechanisms that are distinct from production replication, namely, lytic gene
      expression that is independent of viral DNA replication and histone demethylase
      activity. The identification of a DLK-dependent wave of lytic gene expression
      from sensory ganglia will ultimately permit the development of novel therapeutics
      that target lytic gene expression and prevent the earliest stage of reactivation.

TI  - Superinfection Exclusion of Alphaherpesviruses Interferes with Virion
      Trafficking.
PG  - e0068422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00684-22 [doi]
AB  - Superinfection exclusion (SIE) is a phenomenon in which a primary viral infection
      interferes with secondary viral infections within that same cell. Although SIE
      has been observed across many viruses, it has remained relatively understudied. A
      recently characterized glycoprotein D (gD)-independent SIE of alphaherpesviruses 
      presents a novel mechanism of coinfection restriction for herpes simplex virus 1 
      (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV). In this study, we evaluated the role of
      multiplicity of infection (MOI), receptor expression, and trafficking of virions 
      to gain greater insight into potential mechanisms of alphaherpesvirus SIE. We
      observed that high-MOI secondary viral infections were able to overcome SIE in a 
      manner that was independent of receptor availability. We next assessed virion
      localization during SIE through live microscopy of fluorescently labeled virions 
      and capsid assemblies. Analysis of these fluorescent assemblies identified
      changes in the distribution of capsids during SIE. These results indicate that
      SIE during PRV infection inhibits viral entry or fusion while HSV-1 SIE inhibits 
      infection through a postentry mechanism. Although the timing and phenotype of SIE
      are similar between alphaherpesviruses, the related viruses implement different
      mechanisms to restrict coinfection. IMPORTANCE Most viruses utilize a form of
      superinfection exclusion to conserve resources and control population dynamics.
      gD-dependent superinfection exclusion in alphaherpesviruses is well documented.
      However, the undercharacterized gD-independent SIE provides new insight into how 
      alphaherpesviruses limit sequential infection. The observations described here
      demonstrate that gD-independent SIE differs between PRV and HSV-1. Comparing
      these differences provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of SIE
      implemented by two related viruses.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.24255 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is the most common cause of nonendemic
      sporadic encephalitis in the United States. Treatment with acyclovir has been
      proven to reduce mortality by 50%. Antiviral therapy should be initiated
      immediately in patients with clinical suspicion of viral encephalitis and should 
      not be delayed by serological confirmation of the diagnosis. The most common
      central nervous system complication of HSV encephalitis is seizures (38%), while 
      intracranial hemorrhage is very rare (2.7%). We describe a case of a 59-year-old 
      African American male who presented to the hospital after being found
      unresponsive for a day and was found to have HSV-1 encephalitis that was
      complicated by hemorrhagic conversion. Our patient's neurological status did not 
      improve even with appropriate antiviral treatment with a 28-day course of
      intravenous (IV) acyclovir. Intracranial hemorrhage is a rare complication in
      patients with HSV encephalitis. Close monitoring of neurological status is
      recommended for signs of deterioration or lack of improvement, and further
      imagings are needed (as in our patient) to evaluate for neurological
      complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.

AB  - Acyclovir is an antiviral drug that is frequently prescribed for the herpes
      virus. However, the drug requires frequent dosing due to limited bioavailability 
      (10-26.7%). The rationale of the present study was to develop a self-dissolving
      microneedle system for local and systemic delivery of acyclovir using a topical
      lyophilized wafer on microneedle-treated skin to provide the drug at the site of 
      infection. The microneedles prepared with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)
      (8% w/w) or HPMC (8% w/w)-polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) (30% w/w) penetrated
      excised rat skin, showing sufficient mechanical strength and rapid polymer
      dissolution. The topical wafer was prepared with acyclovir (40% w/w; equivalent
      to 200 mg of drug), gelatin (10% w/w), mannitol (5% w/w), and sodium chloride (5%
      w/w). The uniform distribution of acyclovir within the wafer in an amorphous form
      was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric
      analysis (TGA). No polymer-drug interaction was evident in the lyophilized wafer 
      as per Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The wafer showed 
      a sufficiently porous structure for rapid hydration as per scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) analysis. During ex-vivo analysis, the skin was pre-treated with
      a self-dissolving microneedle array for 5 minutes, and the wafer was placed on
      this microporated-skin. Topical wafer provided approximately 7-11 times higher
      skin concentration than the ID99 reported with a lower lag-time. Based on in-vivo
      testing, approximately 2.58 microg/ml of Cmax was achieved in rabbit plasma
      during 24 hours' study. Our findings suggest that the self-dissolving
      microneedle-assisted topical wafer, proposed for the first time, would be
      efficacious against the infection residing in the skin layer and for systemic
      therapy.

TI  - Evaluation of the Presence of Bacterial and Viral Agents in the Semen of
      Infertile Men: A Systematic and Meta-Analysis Review Study.
PG  - 835254
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.835254 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Infections in the male genitourinary system with bacterial and viral 
      agents may play a significant role in male infertility. These agents usually
      infect the urethra, seminal vesicles, prostate, epididymis, vas deferens, and
      testes retrograde through the reproductive system. A meta-analysis review study
      was performed to evaluate the presence of bacterial and viral agents in the semen
      of infertile men and its correlation with infertility. Methods: Relevant
      cross-sectional and/or case-control studies were found by an online review of
      national and international databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Science
      Direct, and Google scholar), and suitable studies were selected. A checklist
      determined the qualities of all studies. Heterogeneity assay among the primary
      studies was evaluated by Cochran's Q test and I(2) index (significance level
      50%). A statistical analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Stata ver. 14 
      package (StataCorp, College Station, TX, United States). Results: Seventy-two
      studies were included in this meta-analysis. Publication bias was compared with
      Egger's test, and the impact of each research on overall estimate was evaluated
      by sensitivity analysis. In 56 studies, the rate of bacterial infections in the
      semen of infertile men was 12% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10-13]. Also, in 26
      case-control studies, the association of infertility in men with bacterial
      infections was evaluated. The results show that the odds ratio of infertility in 
      men exposed to bacterial infections is 3.31 times higher than that in
      non-infected men (95% CI: 2.60-4.23). Besides, in 9 studies that examined the
      prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), herpes
      simplex virus 2 (HSV2), and herpes simplex virus 1-2 (HSV1-2) in infertile men,
      the frequency of these viruses was 15% (95% CI: 9-21). In 6 case-control studies,
      the association between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 
      HPV and male infertility was evaluated. The chance of male infertility due to
      exposure to these viruses was 2.24 times higher than those without exposure to
      these viruses (CI 95%: 1.9-4.52). The results show that the chance of infertility
      in men exposed to bacteria was significantly higher than that in the uninfected
      population. Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that viral and bacterial
      infections are a risk factor and could impair male fertility potential. Moreover,
      our study supports the hypothesis that bacterial and viral infections of the
      genital tract correlate positively with impairment of sperm quality in the male
      population.

      Cases.
PG  - 7094893
LID - 10.1155/2022/7094893 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recurrence of herpetic keratitis following vaccination has been
      documented following vaccination with the Zostavax, trivalent flu, hepatitis A,
      and rabies vaccines. The USFDA and WHO have acknowledged that the novel COVID-19 
      vaccines similarly have a risk of reactive immunologic-based inflammation,
      namely, myositis, pericarditis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Case Presentation.
      We present two patients with latent herpetic keratitis who experienced
      reactivation of keratitis within weeks of COVID-19 vaccination despite prolonged 
      periods of prior latency. A 52-year-old healthy male with no herpes simplex virus
      (HSV) keratitis recurrences in two years developed visual decline and patchy
      stromal haze within 24-48 hours of receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech (COVID-19
      BNT162b2) vaccine. A 67-year-old female with chronic neurotrophic keratitis
      developed her most severe exacerbation of herpes zoster keratitis in over 10
      years occurring 2-3 weeks after her first Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine, which was 
      later complicated by bacterial superinfection. Conclusions: The COVID-19 vaccines
      work by generating both adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses in humans,
      including elevation of anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, antigen-specific 
      CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines
      such as interferon gamma (IFNgamma). The general activation of the
      T-cell-mediated immune response and proinflammatory cytokines such as IFNgamma
      may underlie the role of the COVID vaccines in reactivation of herpetic stromal
      keratitis and the clinical findings in our reported cases.

AB  - Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes
      (MELAS) syndrome presents with the features of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE),
      which is rare and has been described in only a few case reports. Our case
      describes a 17-year-old female with no significant previous medical history
      presenting with an acute onset of fever, headache, and epilepsy, similar to HSE. 
      Computed tomography of the brain showed bilateral basal ganglia calcification.
      Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated gyriform restricted diffusion with
      T2-weighted images prolongation. Further investigation showed elevated blood
      lactate concentration at rest. Hence, MELAS was suspected and the diagnosis was
      confirmed by the presence of a nucleotide 3243 A-->G mutation in the
      mitochondrial DNA. The clinical presentation and imaging studies of MELAS are
      variable and may mimic those of HSE. Infection may have also precipitated MELAS
      manifestation in this patient. Laboratory features, such as elevated lactate,
      basal ganglia calcification, and gyriform restricted diffusion may be helpful in 
      identifying patients with MELAS.

AB  - Cryo-soft-X-ray tomography is being increasingly used in biological research to
      study the morphology of cellular compartments and how they change in response to 
      different stimuli, such as viral infections. Segmentation of these compartments
      is limited by time-consuming manual tools or machine learning algorithms that
      require extensive time and effort to train. Here we describe Contour, a new,
      easy-to-use, highly automated segmentation tool that enables accelerated
      segmentation of tomograms to delineate distinct cellular compartments. Using
      Contour, cellular structures can be segmented based on their projection intensity
      and geometrical width by applying a threshold range to the image and excluding
      noise smaller in width than the cellular compartments of interest. This method is
      less laborious and less prone to errors from human judgement than current tools
      that require features to be manually traced, and does not require training
      datasets as would machine-learning driven segmentation. We show that
      high-contrast compartments such as mitochondria, lipid droplets, and features at 
      the cell surface can be easily segmented with this technique in the context of
      investigating herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Contour can extract geometric
      measurements from 3D segmented volumes, providing a new method to quantitate
      cryo-soft-X-ray tomography data. Contour can be freely downloaded at
      github.com/kamallouisnahas/Contour.

AB  - Emodin is an anthraquinone derivative that is widely present in natural plants
      and has a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, such as antibacterial,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anticancer and so on. Through reviewing
      studies on antiviral effect of emodin in the past decades, we found that emodin
      exhibits ability of inhibiting the infection and replication of more than 10
      viruses in vitro and in vivo, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and
      type 2 (HSV-2), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
      coxsackievirus B (CVB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza A virus (IAV),
      SARS-CoV, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV), enterovirus 71
      (EV71), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Therefore, this
      review aims to summarize the antiviral effect of emodin, in order to provide
      reference and hopes to support the further investigations.

AB  - Objective: Placement of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) in asymptomatic 
      woman infected with sexually transmitted infection (STIs) can lead to pelvic
      inflammatory diseases (PID) and infertility if not well treated. The current
      study investigated the magnitude of sexually transmitted infections among women
      opting for IUCD use in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional
      study involving 150 asymptomatic women was conducted from August to December
      2017. Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis antigen from endocervical swabs was done
      using immunochromatographic rapid tests while sera were used for detection of
      Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus
      Type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies. Results: The overall prevalence of STIs was 45/150
      (30%, 95% CI: 22-37) while that of individual STIs were 27.3%, 5.3%, and 2.6% for
      C trachomatis, T pallidum, and HSV-2, respectively. History of dysuria (aOR 6.6; 
      95% CI 2.3-18.8; p < 0.001) and history of STIs (aOR 4.6; 95%CI 1.0-20.8; p =
      0.049) independently predicted presence of STIs. Conclusions: Prevalence of STIs 
      among women opted for IUCD use in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania is alarmingly high
      and is predicted by past history of dysuria and history of partner's STIs,
      calling for the need of screening of the STIs among high-risk women in low- and
      middle-income countries (LMICs) opting for IUCD use.

TI  - Bell's palsy with Herpes simplex disciform keratitis: A case report.
PG  - 101575
LID - 10.1016/j.ajoc.2022.101575 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To report a novel case of unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy
      manifesting as a complication of Herpes simplex keratitis. Observations: A
      51-year-old immunocompetent male presented with severe eye pain for 3 weeks. He
      was found to have Herpes simplex keratitis in the left eye and started on
      valacyclovir 3g per day for 10 days. At three weeks his pain and blurred vision
      resolved. He returned 2.5 months later with worsening of vision and five days of 
      unilateral facial numbness and weakness. Ocular evaluation revealed a visual
      acuity of 20/25 in the left eye, which showed mid-stromal corneal edema bordered 
      by several keratoprecipitates. Both the keratitis and Bell's palsy markedly
      improved with valacyclovir, topical prednisolone, and a 10-day course of oral
      prednisone. Conclusions and Importance: This is the first reported case of Bell's
      palsy accompanying disciform keratitis. Both entities have been observed to be
      caused by Herpes simplex, however they have not been described together in one
      patient. Knowledge that these conditions may present simultaneously allows for
      earlier identification and treatment, resulting in decreased morbidity.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the results of femtosecond laser-assisted arcuate keratotomy in
      extreme astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty, using a Ziemer LDVZ6 with a
      modified Lindstrom nomogram. DESIGN: Case series, retrospective study. METHOD:
      Consecutive eyes that underwent femtosecond laser-assisted arcuate keratotomy
      between 2014 and 2019 in the Nantes University Hospital for extreme astigmatism
      after penetrating keratoplasty were included. RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes of 24
      patients were included. The mean age was 53.3+/-12.2 years at the time of the
      arcuate keratotomies. Indications for penetrating keratoplasty were keratoconus
      in 66.7% of cases, herpes keratitis in 16.7% of cases, and corneal dystrophy in
      16.7% of cases. The mean initial best corrected visual acuity was 0.36+/-0.23
      logMar versus 0.26+/-0.15 logMar at the 3-month postoperative visit (P=0.04). At 
      the postoperative visit, 54% (13/24) of eyes had improved best corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), and 25% had no change in BCVA, with a mean cylinder reduction of
      3.3 diopters. The mean preoperative topographic cylinder was 9.5+/-3.2 diopters
      versus 6.2+/-2.8 diopters postoperatively (absolute values; P<0.001), i.e. a
      34.7% reduction in astigmatism. At the 3-month postoperative visit, 20.8% of eyes
      (5/24) had topographic astigmatism less than 3 diopters with a mean astigmatism
      reduction of 97+/-55% (range: 17; 201) using the Alpins method. No suppurative
      keratitis or endophthalmitis were observed. Twenty-one percent of patients
      underwent a second arcuate keratotomy after 3 to 6 months due to insufficient
      refractive results. CONCLUSION: Development of new nomograms designed for extreme
      astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty would enhance the precision and
      reproducibility of femtosecond laser-assisted arcuate keratotomy in these cases.

TI  - Extensive eczema herpeticum in a previously well child.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s12245-022-00425-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eczema herpeticum, also known as Kaposi varicelliform eruption, is a 
      potentially life-threatening disseminated cutaneous viral infection. In the
      majority of cases, this condition develops as a complication in patients with
      atopic dermatitis. However, it may arise in a wide spectrum of pre-existing skin 
      conditions, including psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis,
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma, pemphigus vulgaris, and others. CASE PRESENTATION: We 
      present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to the emergency department 
      because of a high-grade fever and rash. The fever started 2 days before his
      presentation, and its maximum measurement was 39.6 degrees C. The following day, 
      the patient developed numerous painful, pruritic vesiculopustular eruptions, and 
      oozing involving the lips, rendering the patient unable to tolerate oral feeding.
      The patient was seen by the dermatology team who diagnosed the child as having
      eczema herpeticum. The patient was commenced on antiviral and empirical
      antibiotic therapy in the form of intravenous acyclovir and cephalexin along with
      topical fusidic acid and panthenol. The patient showed clinical improvement with 
      resolution of the fever and partial involution of the rash 2 days following the
      administration of the antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: Eczema herpeticum is a
      rare clinical entity that can result in significant morbidity. The case
      highlights the importance of considering the diagnosis of eczema herpeticum in
      the appropriate clinical settings, even in patients who were not known to have
      any prior skin disorder.

TI  - Adult Vaccination as a Protective Factor for Dementia: A Meta-Analysis and
      Systematic Review of Population-Based Observational Studies.
PG  - 872542
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.872542 [doi]
AB  - Background: Common vaccinations may have impacts on dementia risk, but current
      evidence is inconsistent. We therefore investigated the association between
      vaccinations and dementia risk by systematic review and meta-analysis approach.
      Methods: We conducted an extensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library,
      and Web of Science to identify studies that compared the risk of dementia in
      vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled as measures. Results: Of
      the 9124 records initially retrieved, 17 studies with 1857134 participants were
      included in our analysis. The overall pooled results showed that vaccinations
      were associated with a 35% lower dementia risk (HR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.60-0.71, P
      overall effect < 0.001; I(2 =) 91.8%, P heterogeneity<0.001). All types of
      vaccination were associated with a trend toward reduced dementia risk, with
      rabies (HR=0.43), tetanus & diphtheria & pertussis (Tdap) (HR=0.69), herpes
      zoster (HR=0.69), influenza (HR=0.74), hepatitis A (HR=0.78), typhoid (HR=0.80), 
      and hepatitis B (HR=0.82) vaccinations being significant. Individuals with more
      full vaccination types and more annual influenza vaccinations were less likely to
      develop dementia. Gender and age had no effect on this association. Conclusion:
      Routine adult vaccinations are associated with a significant reduction in
      dementia risk and may be an effective strategy for dementia prevention. Further
      research is needed to elucidate the causal effects of this association and the
      underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Sweet's Syndrome Accompanied by Coinfection with Multiple Pathogens and
      Disseminated Mycobacterium phlei Infection Presenting with Osteolytic Destruction
      During 12 Years of Follow-Up: A Rare Case Report.
PG  - 2459-2467
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S360063 [doi]
AB  - Background: Anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies (AIGAs) are closely related to the
      disseminated infection of multiple pathogens. Mycobacterium phlei (M. phlei) is a
      nonpathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and M. phlei infection of the
      bone is extremely rare. We report a rare case of high-titer AIGAs presenting with
      Sweet's syndrome (SS) accompanied by opportunistic coinfection with multiple
      pathogens during 12 years of follow-up. The patient in this case also developed
      disseminated M. phlei infection with osteolytic destruction after treatment for
      SS. Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our hospital
      in August 2009 due to fever and cough with expectoration for 3 months. The
      patient was successively infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, herpes zoster virus
      and Candida. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed recurrent consolidations in
      different lung fields. After 15 months of antimicrobial treatment, the patient
      experienced partial recovery. In September 2010, the patient was pathologically
      diagnosed with SS due to the presence of multiple rashes. After prednisone and
      thalidomide treatment, the rashes subsided, and the pulmonary lesions had
      completely absorbed. In May 2011, the patient was diagnosed with disseminated
      tuberculosis and was administered anti-tuberculosis therapy for 3 months without 
      improvement. NTM was subsequently cultured from her sputum and chest wall pus,
      and she improved after 20 months of anti-NTM therapy. In March 2016, the patient 
      developed osteolytic destruction of the C7-T2 vertebral bodies with a back
      abscess. NTM was eventually cultured from the dorsal abscess pus and further
      identified as M. phlei. High-titer AIGAs were detected in the patient's serum.
      After another round of aggressive anti-NTM therapy, the patient was finally
      cured. Conclusion: Patients with AIGA-associated anti-cytokine autoantibody
      disease can present with multiple opportunistic infections and SS involving the
      lung. AIGA-associated immunodeficiency leads to infection with nonpathogenic M.
      phlei, which is refractory, can cause relapse, and even leads to osteolytic
      destruction.

TI  - Initial TK-deficient HSV-1 infection in the lip alters contralateral lip
      challenge immune dynamics.
PG  - 8489
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12597-4 [doi]
AB  - Primary infection with herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) occurring around the mouth
      and nose switches rapidly to lifelong latent infection in sensitive trigeminal
      ganglia (TG) neurons. Sporadic reactivation of these latent reservoirs later in
      life is the cause of acute infections of the corneal epithelium, which can cause 
      potentially blinding herpes simplex keratitis (HSK). There is no effective
      vaccine to protect against HSK, and antiviral drugs provide only partial
      protection against recurrences. We previously engendered an acute disease-free,
      non-reactivating latent state in mice when challenged with virulent HSV-1 in
      orofacial mucosa, by priming with non-neurovirulent HSV-1 (TKdel) before the
      challenge. Herein, we define the local immune infiltration and inflammatory
      chemokine production changes after virulent HSV-1 challenge, which were elicited 
      by TKdel prime. Heightened immunosurveillance before virulent challenge, and
      early enhanced lymphocyte-enriched infiltration of the challenged lip were
      induced, which corresponded to attenuation of inflammation in the TG and enhanced
      viral control. Furthermore, classical latent-phase T cell persistence around
      latent HSV-1 reservoirs were severely reduced. These findings identify the immune
      processes that are likely to be responsible for establishing non-reactivating
      latent HSV-1 reservoirs. Stopping reactivation is essential for development of
      efficient vaccine strategies against HSV-1.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of herpes simplex virus retinitis following ChadOx1
      nCoV-19 (covishield) vaccination. CASE REPORT: A 29 year old immunocompetent male
      presented with unilateral disc edema with adjacent retinitis two days after
      receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. Extensive investigations
      to rule out infective etiology were negative except for polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) of the vitreous specimen which was positive for the herpes simplex virus. A
      diagnosis of herpes simplex (HSV) retinitis post covid vaccination was made. The 
      patient responded well to oral antivirals and steroids. CONCLUSION: HSV retinitis
      is a rare complication following the COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Identifying risk factors for prevalent anal human papillomavirus type 16
      infection in women living with HIV.
PG  - e0268521
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women living with HIV (WLHIV) have a high risk of anal cancer.
      Identifying risk factors for anal HPV 16 infection, the most significant risk
      factor for anal cancer, is essential for prevention and screening strategies.
      METHODS: In the EVVA Cohort study, 151 WLHIV had cervical and anal HPV testing
      with genotyping every 6 months for 2 years, while demographic and clinical data
      were collected via questionnaires and chart reviews. Here, we present results of 
      baseline data analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among
      150 women with adequate HPV test results at baseline, HPV 16 DNA was detected
      anally in 23 (15.3%; 95%CI:10.4-22.1) and cervically in 5 (3.3%; 95%CI:1.4-7.8). 
      In multivariable analysis, current smoking (OR = 6.0; 95%CI: 1.5-23.9), nadir CD4
      count </= 200 cells/muL (OR = 8.4; 95%CI: 2.0-34.3), prevalent cervical HPV 16
      (OR = 14.7; 95%CI: 1.0-222.5) and anogenital herpes in previous 6 months (OR =
      9.8, 95%CI: 1.7-56.8) were associated with prevalent anal HPV 16. CONCLUSIONS:
      Knowledge of risk factors can help identify WLHIV at greatest risk of anal HPV 16
      infection and, potentially, developing subsequent anal cancer. Identification of 
      the subgroup of these women in whom HPV 16 persists could be an early step in the
      algorithm of anal cancer screening.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes chronic infection in the human host,
      characterized by self-limited episodes of mucosal shedding and lesional disease, 
      with latent infection of neuronal ganglia. The epidemiology of genital herpes has
      undergone a significant transformation over the past two decades, with the
      emergence of HSV-1 as a leading cause of first-episode genital herpes in many
      countries. Though dsDNA viruses are not expected to mutate quickly, it is not yet
      known to what degree the HSV-1 viral population in a natural host adapts over
      time, or how often viral population variants are transmitted between hosts. This 
      study provides a comparative genomics analysis for 33 temporally-sampled oral and
      genital HSV-1 genomes derived from five adult sexual transmission pairs. We found
      that transmission pairs harbored consensus-level viral genomes with near-complete
      conservation of nucleotide identity. Examination of within-host minor variants in
      the viral population revealed both shared and unique patterns of genetic
      diversity between partners, and between anatomical niches. Additionally, genetic 
      drift was detected from spatiotemporally separated samples in as little as three 
      days. These data expand our prior understanding of the complex interaction
      between HSV-1 genomics and population dynamics after transmission to new infected
      persons.

TI  - Adverse weather during in utero development is linked to higher rates of
      later-life herpesvirus reactivation in adult European badgers, Meles meles.
PG  - 211749
LID - 10.1098/rsos.211749 [doi]
AB  - Maternal immune and/or metabolic conditions relating to stress or nutritional
      status can affect in utero development among offspring with subsequent
      implications for later-life responses to infections. We used free-ranging
      European badgers as a host-pathogen model to investigate how prenatal weather
      conditions affect later-life herpesvirus genital tract reactivation. We applied a
      sliding window analysis of weather conditions to 164 samples collected in 2018
      from 95 individuals born between 2005-2016. We test if the monthly mean and
      variation in rainfall and temperature experienced by their mother during the 12
      months of delayed implantation and gestation prior to parturition subsequently
      affected individual herpes reactivation rates among these offspring. We
      identified four influential prenatal seasonal weather windows that corresponded
      with previously identified critical climatic conditions affecting badger
      survival, fecundity and body condition. These all occurred during the
      pre-implantation rather than the post-implantation period. We conclude that
      environmental cues during the in utero period of delayed implantation may result 
      in changes that affect an individual's developmental programming against
      infection or viral reactivation later in life. This illustrates how prenatal
      adversity caused by environmental factors, such as climate change, can impact
      wildlife health and population dynamics-an interaction largely overlooked in
      wildlife management and conservation programmes.

AB  - Docosanol is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      over-the-counter topical product for treating recurrent oral-facial herpes
      simplex labialis. Validated analytical methods for docosanol are required to
      demonstrate the bioequivalence of docosanol topical products. A gas
      chromatography/selected ion monitoring mode mass spectrometry (GC/SIM-MS) method 
      was developed and validated for docosanol determination in biological samples.
      Docosanol and isopropyl palmitate (internal standard) were separated on a
      high-polarity GC capillary column with (88% cyanopropy)aryl-polysiloxane employed
      as the stationary phase. The ions of m/z 83 and 256 were selected to monitor
      docosanol and isopropyl palmitate, respectively; the total run time was 20 min.
      The GC/SIM-MS method was validated in accordance with US FDA guidelines, and the 
      results met the US FDA acceptance criteria. The docosanol calibration standards
      were linear in the 100-10000 ng/mL concentration range (R (2)>0.994). The
      recoveries for docosanol from the receptor fluid and skin homogenates were >93.2%
      and >95.8%, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to
      analyze ex vivo human cadaver skin permeation samples. On applying Abreva(R)
      cream tube and Abreva(R) cream pump, the amount of docosanol that penetrated
      human cadaver skin at 48 h was 21.5 +/- 7.01 and 24.0 +/- 6.95 ng/mg,
      respectively. Accordingly, we concluded that the validated GC/SIM-MS was
      sensitive, specific, and suitable for quantifying docosanol as a quality control 
      tool. This method can be used for routine analysis as a cost-effective
      alternative to other techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few Japanese hospitals can perform in-house cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to screen for herpes simplex virus, leading to
      patients being administered acyclovir (ACV) for several days. The FilmArray
      Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel (ME Panel) is a multiplex PCR test that can
      identify 14 major pathogens within 1 h. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of
      the ME Panel in children admitted with central nervous system infections in
      Japan. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, quasi-experimental study. The ME
      panel was introduced in April 2020. We outsourced the CSF samples to a laboratory
      during the pre-intervention period (April 2016 to March 2020) and performed the
      ME panel at our hospital during the post-intervention period (April 2020 to
      December 2021). Duration and dose of ACV and antibiotic use, length of stay (LOS)
      in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and total LOS after testing were
      compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The number of cases in the pre- 
      and post-intervention periods was 67 and 22 cases, respectively. The median
      duration of ACV decreased significantly from 6 days to 0 day (p < 0.001), and the
      median dose of ACV use decreased significantly from 14 vials to 0 vial (p <
      0.001). No significant differences were noted in the total duration and dose of
      antibiotic use, LOS in PICU, and the total LOS after testing. CONCLUSION: The
      introduction of ME panel may contribute to appropriate ACV use; however, there
      was no significant change in the duration and dose of antibiotic use or LOS.

AB  - Atlantic salmon is one of the most famous and economically important fish species
      globally. However, bacterial diseases constantly constrain salmon aquaculture.
      Thereinto, Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. masoucida (ASM), classified as atypical
      A. salmonicida, caused huge losses to salmonid industry in China. In this regard,
      we conducted transcriptome analysis in Atlantic salmon head kidney following the 
      administration of ASM vaccination to reveal genes, their expression patterns, and
      pathways involved in immune responses. A total of 448.71 million clean reads were
      obtained, and 397.69 million reads were mapped onto the Atlantic salmon reference
      genome. In addition, 117, 1891, 741, 207, and 377 genes were significantly
      up-regulated, and 183, 1920, 695, 83, and 539 genes were significantly
      down-regulated post ASM vaccination at 12 h, 24 h, 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m,
      respectively. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that many
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following ASM vaccination were involved in 
      cell adhesion molecules (H2-Aa-l and CD28-l),cytokine-cytokine receptor
      interaction (IL10, CXCL9, CXCL11, CXCR3, and CCL19), herpes simplex infection
      (IL1B, SOCS3-l, and C3-l), HTLV-I infection (Il1r2 and BCL2L1), influenza A
      (CXCL8 and Il12b), and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (PIK3R3-l and Ddit4-l).
      Finally, the results of qRT-PCR showed a significant correlation with RNA-Seq
      results, suggesting the reliability of RNA-Seq for gene expression analysis. This
      study sets the foundation for further study on the vaccine protective mechanism
      in Atlantic salmon as well as other teleost species.

AB  - Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a modified herpes simplex virus type 1, which
      can be administered intralesionally in patients with stage IIIB/C-IVM1a (American
      Joint Committee of Cancer; AJCC 7th edition) unresectable melanoma. In the case
      of disease recurrence, T-VEC can be re-introduced for the same category of
      patients. Five patients with recurrent disease after a prior achieved complete
      response (CR) recommenced treatment with T-VEC monotherapy at the Netherlands
      Cancer Institute. We collected data on response, adverse events and baseline
      characteristics. All 5 patients that were re-treated with T-VEC presented with
      in-transit metastases on the lower limb. Median age at baseline was 72.1 years
      with a median follow-up time of 30.4 months. Histologically proven CR was
      achieved after a median of 8 T-VEC courses on the initial exposure. Duration of
      response (time between first CR and recurrence) varied between 3.8 and 14.2
      months. All 5 patients achieved a histologically and/or positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography proven CR again after re-introduction of T-VEC
      with a median of 5 courses. One patient (20%) developed a second recurrence and
      is currently still on treatment with T-VEC. No patients developed distant
      metastases. Grade 1 adverse events occurred in all patients. Mostly, these
      consisted of fatigue, influenza-like symptoms and injection site pain. Response
      to re-introduction of T-VEC monotherapy in this select patient population is
      promising. This real world data on re-introduction of T-VEC monotherapy in stage 
      IIIB/C-IVM1a melanoma suggests T-VEC could be a treatment option for chronic
      disease control.

TI  - UNC93B1 attenuates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by targeting STING for
      autophagy-lysosome degradation.
PG  - 4490-4501
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27860 [doi]
AB  - Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a pivotal innate immune adaptor, and
      its functions during DNA virus infections have been extensively documented.
      However, its homeostatic regulation is not well understood. Our study
      demonstrates that Unc-93 homolog B1 (UNC93B1) is a crucial checker for STING to
      prevent hyperactivation. Ectopic expression of UNC93B1 attenuates IFN-beta
      promoter activity and the transcriptions of IFN-beta, ISG54, and ISG56 genes.
      Moreover, UNC93B1 also blocks the IRF3 nuclear translocation induced by ectopic
      expression of both cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and STING and reduces the
      stability of STING by facilitating its autophagy-lysosome degradation, which can 
      be reversed by lysosome inhibitors. Mechanistically, UNC93B1 interacts with STING
      and suppresses STING-activated downstream signaling by delivering STING to the
      lysosomes for degradation, depending on its trafficking capability. UNC93B1
      knockout in human embryonic kidney 293T cells facilitates IFN-beta promoter
      activity, IFN-beta, ISG54, and ISG56 transcriptions, and IRF3 nuclear
      translocation induced by ectopic expression of cGAS and STING. Infected with
      herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), UNC93B1 knockdown BJ cells or primary peritoneal 
      macrophages from Unc93b1-deficient (Unc93b1(-/-) ) mice show enhanced IFN-beta,
      ISG54, and ISG56 transcriptions, TBK1 phosphorylation, and reduced STING
      degradation and viral replication. In addition, Unc93b1(-/-) mice exhibit higher 
      IFN-beta, ISG54, and ISG56 transcriptions and lower mortality upon HSV-1
      infection in vivo. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that UNC93B1
      attenuates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by targeting STING for
      autophagy-lysosome degradation and provide novel insights into the function of
      UNC93B1 in antiviral innate immunity.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the complication risk and prevalence
      after phacoemulsification in cats with presumed congenital/inherited cataracts.
      Twelve client-owned cats were included in the study. This retrospective study
      spanned 13 yr and involved 22 eyes. The median age at the time of surgery was 15 
      mo (range: 4.5-168 mo of age). Recorded complications were 3 eyes developed
      postoperative ocular hypertension, 1 eye developed glaucoma, 7 eyes developed
      feline herpes virus-1 signs, and 7 eyes developed postoperative uveitis >2 wk
      after surgery. No eyes had developed intraocular sarcomas at the time of their
      last exam. All eyes remained visual at last follow-up (range: 0.5-121 mo).
      Success was defined as a comfortable and visual eye without intraocular
      neoplasia, glaucoma, a partial or complete retinal detachment, or uveitis that
      occurred >2 wk after surgery or persisted longer than 2 wk. Twenty-one out of 22 
      eyes had a successful outcome. In this study, cats with presumed
      congenital/juvenile cataracts who underwent phacoemulsification had an excellent 
      outcome.

TI  - The Nuclear DNA Sensor IFI16 Indiscriminately Binds to and Diminishes
      Accessibility of the HSV-1 Genome to Suppress Infection.
PG  - e0019822
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00198-22 [doi]
AB  - Human cells identify invading pathogens and activate immune signaling pathways
      through a wide array of pattern recognition receptors, including DNA sensors. The
      interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) is a nuclear DNA sensor that recognizes
      double-stranded DNA from a number of viral sources, including genomes of
      nuclear-replicating viruses. Among these is the prevalent human pathogen herpes
      simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Upon binding to the HSV-1 DNA genome, IFI16 both induces
      antiviral cytokine expression and suppresses virus gene expression. Here, we used
      a multiomics approach of DNA sequencing techniques paired with targeted mass
      spectrometry to obtain an extensive view of the interaction between IFI16 and the
      HSV-1 genome and how this binding affects the viral DNA structure and protein
      expression. Through chromatin immunoaffinity purification coupled with
      next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that IFI16 binds to the HSV-1
      genome in a sequence-independent manner while simultaneously exhibiting broad
      enrichment at two loci: UL30, the viral DNA polymerase gene, and US1 to US7. The 
      assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) revealed
      that these two regions are among the most accessible stretches of DNA on the
      genome, thereby facilitating IFI16 binding. Accessibility of the entire HSV-1
      genome is elevated upon IFI16 knockout, indicating that expression of IFI16
      globally induces chromatinization of viral DNA. Deletion of IFI16 also results in
      a global increase in the expression of HSV-1 proteins, as measured by parallel
      reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry of viral proteins representing 80% of the
      HSV-1 genome. Altogether, we demonstrate that IFI16 interacts with the HSV-1
      genome in a sequence-independent manner, coordinating epigenetic silencing of the
      viral genome and decreasing protein expression and virus replication. IMPORTANCE 
      Mammalian host defense against viral infection includes broad-acting cellular
      restriction factors, as well as effectors of intrinsic and innate immunity. IFI16
      is a critical nuclear host defense factor and intrinsic immune protein involved
      in binding viral DNA genomes, thereby repressing the replication of
      nucleus-replicating viruses, including the human herpes simplex virus 1. What has
      remained unclear is where on the viral genome IFI16 binds and how binding affects
      both viral DNA structural accessibility and viral protein expression. Our study
      provides a global view of where and how a nuclear restriction factor of DNA
      viruses associates with viral genomes to exert antiviral functions during early
      stages of an acute virus infection. Our study can additionally serve as a
      systems-level model to evaluate nuclear DNA sensor interactions with viral
      genomes, as well as the antiviral outcomes of transcriptionally silencing
      pathogen-derived DNA.

TI  - A Review of the Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus-1 Encephalitis in Six
      Immunocompetent Patients.
PG  - e24129
LID - 10.7759/cureus.24129 [doi]
AB  - Introduction The optimal treatment regimen for herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1)
      encephalitis is ill-defined. Current guidelines recommend the initiation of
      acyclovir in all suspected cases of encephalitis; however, there is limited
      research regarding the details of acyclovir treatment or the adjuvant use of
      corticosteroids. Specifically, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidelines
      detailing the optimal management of HSV-1 encephalitis in immunocompetent
      patients. In this study, we conducted a review of cases of immunocompetent
      patients with HSV-1 encephalitis to compare patterns in treatment and outcomes.
      Methods A review of the literature was performed using PubMed using the terms
      herpes encephalitis, HSV, herpes zoster, and immunocompetent to identify cases of
      HSV-1 encephalitis in immunocompetent patients. The results were screened for
      cases describing the treatment regimen of HSV-1 encephalitis-positive,
      immunocompetent patients. Results Six cases were identified. All six patients
      were treated with acyclovir with one patient receiving adjuvant corticosteroid
      therapy. Additionally, three patients were found to have acyclovir resistance and
      were transitioned to foscarnet. Eventually, one patient expired, two patients
      recovered with chronic morbidities of varying severity, and three patients made a
      full recovery. Discussion Inconsistencies in the patient's disease course,
      therapeutic regimen, and comorbidities could all play a role in the varying case 
      outcomes. While the optimal timing and composition of therapies in HSV-1
      encephalitis in immunocompetent patients are still unclear, it seems the timely
      administration of antiviral treatment remains essential. Further research is
      needed to optimize HSV-1 encephalitis therapeutic regimens and improve patient
      outcomes.

AB  - Ear shingles, also called herpes zoster oticus, are a viral infection of the
      outer, middle and/or inner ear due to varicella zoster virus (VZV). Patients with
      ear involvement associated with facial palsy are clinically diagnosed with
      Ramsay-Hunt s syndrome. We here report the case of a 25-year-old patient with
      herpes zoster oticus associated with peripheral facial palsy, without other
      associated signs. This study and literature review investigate the various
      clinical, para-clinical and evolutionary features of herpes zoster oticus and the
      therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising milieu for broad-based 
      cancer and infectious disease diagnostics. The performance of cfDNA sequencing
      for infectious disease diagnostics is chiefly limited by inadequate analytical
      sensitivity. The current study investigated whether the analytical sensitivity of
      cfDNA sequencing for viral diagnostics could be improved by selective sequencing 
      of short cfDNA fragments, given prior observations of shorter fragment size
      distribution in microbial and cytomegalovirus-derived cfDNA compared with
      human-derived cfDNA. It shows that the shorter plasma cfDNA fragment size
      distribution is a general feature of multiple DNA viruses, including adenovirus
      [interquartile range (IQR), 87 to 165 bp], herpes simplex virus 2 (IQR, 114 to
      195 bp), human herpesvirus 6 (IQR, 145 to 176 bp), and varicella zoster virus
      (IQR, 98 to 182 bp), compared with human (IQR, 148 to 178 bp). It was used to
      further optimize a size selection-based cfDNA sequencing method, demonstrating an
      enrichment of viral sequences up to 16.6-fold, with a median fold enrichment of
      6.7x, 4.6x, 2.2x, and 10.3x for adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 2, human
      herpesvirus 6, and varicella zoster virus, respectively. These findings
      demonstrate a simple yet scalable method for enhanced detection of DNA viremia
      that maintains the unbiased nature of cfDNA sequencing.

TI  - Infectious risk of add-on leflunomide or tacrolimus versus TNF inhibitors among
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving background methotrexate: A
      population-based cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare infectious risk between leflunomide versus TNF inhibitors 
      (TNFi), and between tacrolimus versus TNFi among rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      patients receiving methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Using Korea National Health
      Insurance Service database, we conducted a cohort study on RA patients initiating
      TNFi, leflunomide, or tacrolimus. The primary outcome was any serious infections 
      defined as a composite endpoint of serious bacterial, opportunistic, and herpes
      zoster infections. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary
      outcome. Propensity-score fine-stratification (PSS) and weighting were applied to
      adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models comparing leflunomide versus 
      TNFi, and tacrolimus versus TNFi. RESULTS: Among 72,516 RA patients receiving
      MTX, we identified 3,336 TNFi initiators, 11,122 leflunomide initiators, and
      5,136 tacrolimus initiators. Two study cohorts were 10,992 leflunomide initiators
      PSS-weighted on 1,623 TNFi initiators and 5,126 tacrolimus initiators
      PSS-weighted on 2,521 TNFi initiators. The incidence rate per 100 person-years of
      herpes zoster infection (3.70-4.27) was beyond 3-times that of serious bacterial 
      infection (1.12-1.36), but opportunistic infection was relatively rare
      (0.11-0.23). The PSS-weighted HR [95% CI] for any serious infection was 1.03
      [0.89-1.22] comparing leflunomide versus TNFi, and 0.91 [0.77-1.08] comparing
      tacrolimus versus TNFi. Analyses on the secondary outcomes showed consistent
      results. CONCLUSION: In this nation-wide cohort study, we did not find a
      significant difference in the risk of serious infections (i.e., serious
      bacterial, opportunistic, and herpes zoster infections) between leflunomide
      versus TNFi, and between tacrolimus versus TNFi among RA patients receiving
      background MTX.

      vaccine production.

AB  - Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV).
      Researching and developing a herpes zoster vaccine will help to decrease the
      incidence of herpes zoster. To increase the bioreactor productivity, a serum-free
      HEK293 cell perfusion process with adenovirus vector herpes zoster (rAd-HZ)
      vaccine production was developed efficiently using the design of experiment (DoE)
      method. First, serum-free media for HEK293 cells were screened in both batch and 
      semi-perfusion culture modes. Then, three optimal media were employed in a medium
      mixture design to improve cell culture performance, and the 1:1 mixture of HEK293
      medium and MCD293 medium (named HM293 medium) was identified as the optimal
      formulation. On the basis of the HM293 medium, the relationship of critical
      process parameters (CPPs), including the time of infection (TOI), multiplicity of
      infection (MOI), pH, and critical quality attributes (CQAs) (adenovirus titer
      (Titer), cell-specific virus yield (CSVY), adenovirus fold expansion (Fold)) of
      rAd-HZ production was investigated using the DoE approach. Furthermore, the
      robust setpoint and design space of these CPPs were explored. Finally, the rAd-HZ
      production process with parameters at a robust setpoint (TOI = 7.2 x 10(6)
      cells/mL, MOI = 3.7, and pH = 7.17) was successfully scaled-up to a 3-L
      bioreactor with an alternating tangential flow system, yielding an adenovirus
      titer of 3.0 x 10(10) IFU/mL, a CSVY of 4167 IFU/cells, a Fold of 1117 at 2 days 
      post infection (dpi). The DoE approach accelerated the development of a HEK293
      serum-free medium and of a robust adenovirus production process.

TI  - Incidence and Outcome of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock and Detection of Herpes 
      Simplex Virus in the Lower Respiratory Tract.
LID - 2351 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11092351 [doi]
AB  - (1) Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation in critically ill patients can cause 
      infection in the lower respiratory tract, prolonging mechanical ventilation.
      However, the association of HSV reactivation with cardiogenic shock (CS) is
      unclear. As CS is often accompanied by pulmonary congestion and reduced immune
      system activity, the aim of our study was to determine the incidence and outcome 
      of HSV reactivation in these patients. (2) In this retrospective, single-center
      study, bronchial lavage (BL) was performed on 181 out of 837 CS patients with
      mechanical ventilation. (3) In 44 of those patients, HSV was detected with a
      median time interval of 11 days since intubation. The occurrence of HSV was
      associated with an increase in C-reactive protein and the fraction of inspired
      oxygen at the time of HSV detection. Arterial hypertension, bilirubin on ICU
      admission, the duration of mechanical ventilation and out-of-hospital cardiac
      arrest were associated with HSV reactivation. (4) HSV reactivation could be
      detected in 24.3% of patients with CS on whom BL was performed, and its
      occurrence should be considered in patients with prolonged mechanical
      ventilation. Due to the limited current evidence, the initiation of treatment for
      these patients remains an individual choice. Dedicated randomized studies are
      necessary to investigate the efficacy of antiviral therapy.

TI  - New Derivatives of 5-Substituted Uracils: Potential Agents with a Wide Spectrum
      of Biological Activity.
LID - 2866 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27092866 [doi]
AB  - Pyrimidine nucleoside analogues are widely used to treat infections caused by the
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and DNA viruses from the herpes family. It has
      been shown that 5-substituted uracil derivatives can inhibit HIV-1, herpes family
      viruses, mycobacteria and other pathogens through various mechanisms. Among the
      5-substituted pyrimidine nucleosides, there are not only the classical nucleoside
      inhibitors of the herpes family viruses, 2'-deoxy-5-iodocytidine and
      5-bromovinyl-2'-deoxyuridine, but also derivatives of
      1-(benzyl)-5-(phenylamino)uracil, which proved to be non-nucleoside inhibitors of
      HIV-1 and EBV. It made this modification of nucleoside analogues very promising
      in connection with the emergence of new viruses and the crisis of drug resistance
      when the task of creating effective antiviral agents of new types that act on
      other targets or exhibit activity by other mechanisms is very urgent. In this
      paper, we present the design, synthesis and primary screening of the biological
      activity of new nucleoside analogues, namely, 5'-norcarbocyclic derivatives of
      substituted 5-arylamino- and 5-aryloxyuracils, against RNA viruses.

TI  - Antiviral Peptides (AVPs) of Marine Origin as Propitious Therapeutic Drug
      Candidates for the Treatment of Human Viruses.
LID - 2619 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27092619 [doi]
AB  - The marine environment presents a favorable avenue for potential therapeutic
      agents as a reservoir of new bioactive natural products. Due to their numerous
      potential pharmacological effects, marine-derived natural products-particularly
      marine peptides-have gained considerable attention. These peptides have shown a
      broad spectrum of biological functions, such as antimicrobial, antiviral,
      cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and analgesic effects. The emergence of new virus
      strains and viral resistance leads to continuing efforts to develop more
      effective antiviral drugs. Interestingly, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that
      possess antiviral properties and are alternatively regarded as antiviral peptides
      (AVPs) demonstrate vast potential as alternative peptide-based drug candidates
      available for viral infection treatments. Hence, AVPs obtained from various
      marine organisms have been evaluated. This brief review features recent updates
      of marine-derived AVPs from 2011 to 2021. Moreover, the biosynthesis of this
      class of compounds and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed.
      Selected peptides from various marine organisms possessing antiviral activities
      against important human viruses-such as human immunodeficiency viruses, herpes
      simplex viruses, influenza viruses, hepatitis C virus, and coronaviruses-are
      highlighted herein.

TI  - Anthocyanins in Red Jasmine Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Extracts and Efficacy on
      Inhibition of Herpes Simplex Virus, Free Radicals and Cancer Cell.
LID - 1905 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14091905 [doi]
AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops in many countries, with nutritional 
      value and health benefits. In this study, the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of
      red jasmine rice from Chiang Mai, Thailand were examined for their anthocyanins
      and phenolic contents. The antioxidant and antiviral activity against herpes
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), as well as anticancer activity, 
      were investigated. The total anthocyanins content of 708.03 +/- 11.56 mg Cy-3-glc
      equivalent/g extract, determined from the ethanolic extract, was higher than the 
      aqueous extract. However, the aqueous extract showed the highest total phenolic
      compound of 81.91 +/- 0.51 mg GAE/g extract. In addition, the ethanolic extract
      demonstrated higher antioxidant activity than aqueous extract using DPPH, ABTS,
      and FRAP assays by 28.91 +/- 3.26 mg GAE/g extract, 189.45 +/- 11.58 mg 24 TEAC/g
      extract, and 3292.46 +/- 259.64 g FeSO4/g extract, respectively. In the antiviral
      assay, it was found that the ethanolic extract of red jasmine rice could inhibit 
      HSV-1 more effectively than HSV-2 when treated before, during, and after the
      viral attachment on Vero cells, with 50% effective doses of 227.53 +/- 2.41,
      189.59 +/- 7.76, and 192.62 +/- 2.40 microg/mL, respectively. The extract also
      demonstrated the highest reduction of HSV-1 particles at 4 h after treatment and 
      the inhibition of HSV-1 replication. The ethanolic extract exhibited a higher
      toxicity level than the aqueous extract, as well as the potential to induce DNA
      fragmentation by intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways on the Caco-2 cells. 
      These findings suggest that red jasmine rice extract demonstrates nutritional
      value and biological activity on HSV, free radicals, and cancer cell inhibition.

TI  - It's All in the PAN: Crosstalk, Plasticity, Redundancies, Switches, and
      Interconnectedness Encompassed by PANoptosis Underlying the Totality of Cell
      Death-Associated Biological Effects.
LID - 1495 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11091495 [doi]
AB  - The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against cellular
      perturbations. Innate immune activation elicits inflammatory programmed cell
      death in response to microbial infections or alterations in cellular homeostasis.
      Among the most well-characterized programmed cell death pathways are pyroptosis, 
      apoptosis, and necroptosis. While these pathways have historically been defined
      as segregated and independent processes, mounting evidence shows significant
      crosstalk among them. These molecular interactions have been described as
      'crosstalk', 'plasticity', 'redundancies', 'molecular switches', and more. Here, 
      we discuss the key components of cell death pathways and note several examples of
      crosstalk. We then explain how the diverse descriptions of crosstalk throughout
      the literature can be interpreted through the lens of an integrated inflammatory 
      cell death concept, PANoptosis. The totality of biological effects in PANoptosis 
      cannot be individually accounted for by pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis
      alone. We also discuss PANoptosomes, which are multifaceted macromolecular
      complexes that regulate PANoptosis. We consider the evidence for PANoptosis,
      which has been mechanistically characterized during influenza A virus, herpes
      simplex virus 1, Francisella novicida, and Yersinia infections, as well as in
      response to altered cellular homeostasis, in inflammatory diseases, and in
      cancers. We further discuss the role of IRF1 as an upstream regulator of
      PANoptosis and conclude by reexamining historical studies which lend credence to 
      the PANoptosis concept. Cell death has been shown to play a critical role in
      infections, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and more;
      therefore, having a holistic understanding of cell death is important for
      identifying new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Induces Immunogenic Cell Death Resulting in
      Maturation of BDCA-1(+) Myeloid Dendritic Cells.
LID - 4865 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094865 [doi]
AB  - Recently, a paradigm shift has been established for oncolytic viruses (OVs) as it
      was shown that the immune system plays an important role in the specific killing 
      of tumor cells by OVs. OVs have the intrinsic capacity to provide the right
      signals to trigger anti-tumor immune responses, on the one hand by delivering
      virus-derived innate signals and on the other hand by inducing immunogenic cell
      death (ICD), which is accompanied by the release of various damage-associated
      molecules from infected tumor cells. Here, we determined the ICD-inducing
      capacity of Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), a herpes simplex virus type 1 based
      OV, and benchmarked this to other previously described ICD (e.g., doxorubicin)
      and non-ICD inducing agents (cisplatin). Furthermore, we studied the capability
      of T-VEC to induce the maturation of human BDCA-1(+) myeloid dendritic cells
      (myDCs). We found that T-VEC treatment exerts direct and indirect anti-tumor
      effects as it induces tumor cell death that coincides with the release of
      hallmark mediators of ICD, while simultaneously contributing to the maturation of
      BDCA-1(+) myDCs. These results unequivocally cement OVs in the category of cancer
      immunotherapy.

TI  - CGRP inhibits human Langerhans cells infection with HSV by differentially
      modulating specific HSV-1 and HSV-2 entry mechanisms.
PG  - 762-771

AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is widespread globally, with both HSV-1 and HSV-2
      responsible for genital herpes. During sexual transmission, HSV targets
      epithelial cells, sensory peripheral pain neurons secreting the mucosal
      neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and mucosal immune cells
      including Langerhans cells (LCs). We previously described a neuro-immune
      crosstalk, whereby CGRP inhibits LCs-mediated human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1) transmission. Herein, to further explore CGRP-mediated anti-viral
      function, we investigated whether CGRP affects LCs infection with HSV. We found
      that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 primary isolates productively infect monocyte-derived
      LCs (MDLCs) and inner foreskin LCs. Moreover, CGRP significantly inhibits
      infection with both HSV subtypes of MDLCs and langerin(high), but not
      langerin(low), inner foreskin LCs. For HSV-1, infection is mediated via the
      HSV-1-specific entry receptor 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate (3-OS HS) in a
      pH-depended manner, and CGRP down-regulates 3-OS HS surface expression, as well
      as abrogates pH dependency. For HSV-2, infection involves langerin-mediated
      endocytosis in a pH-independent manner, and CGRP up-regulates surface expression 
      of atypical langerin double-trimer oligomers. Our results show that CGRP inhibits
      mucosal HSV infection by differentially modulating subtype-specific entry
      receptors and mechanisms in human LCs. CGRP could turn out useful for prevention 
      of LCs-mediated HSV infection and HSV/HIV-1 co-infection.

TI  - Research Trends and Hotspots on Herpes Zoster: A 10-Year Bibliometric Analysis
      (2012-2021).
PG  - 850762
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.850762 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Herpes zoster infection, with its considerable burden to individuals and
      society, remains a challenge around the world. However, to the knowledge of the
      authors, little bibliometric quantitative or qualitative analysis has been
      carried out to evaluate herpes zoster research. This study aimed to use a
      bibliometric analysis to evaluate current publication trends and hotspots on
      herpes zoster research worldwide, in order to advance research in this field.
      Methods: Relevant publications from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected 
      from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Citespace (V5.8.R3) was used to
      analyze the research points, including publication countries, institutions and
      authors, cited author, cited reference and their clustering, and keyword
      co-occurrence, and burst keyword to acquire research trends and hotspots.
      Results: A total of 9,259 publications were obtained, with a steady increase in
      the number of annual publications during the decade. Articles were the main type 
      of publication. The United States is the leading country in this research, and
      the University of Colorado has the highest influence in this field. Oxman is the 
      most representative author, with a main research interest in herpes zoster
      vaccines. The top five cited authors' publications focused on herpes zoster
      vaccines, molecular mechanisms, and postherpetic neuralgia. A co-citation map
      resulted 19 main clusters, and revealed that vaccines, postherpetic neuralgia,
      treatments, varicella zoster virus and its mechanisms, and epidemiology of herpes
      zoster were the current research focus after clustering co-cited publications.
      Human herpesviruses, antiviral prophylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, recombinant
      zoster vaccine, varicella vaccination and postherpetic neuralgia were the top
      clusters after co-occurrence keywords analysis. Moreover, burst keywords
      detection showed that the subunit vaccine was the new hotspot in the field of
      herpes zoster. Conclusion: This bibliometric study defined the overall prospects 
      in the field of herpes zoster and provided valuable instruction for the ongoing
      research. The keyword "subunit vaccine" indicated that a vaccine for herpes
      zoster prevention was the hotspot. Efforts to prevent varicella zoster virus
      infection will be essential to improve herpes zoster outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: Neonatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare entity.
      The objective of the study was to describe the prevalence, clinical
      characteristics, interventions and outcomes of neonates diagnosed with HLH in the
      United States. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2009, 2012, and 2016 Kids'
      Inpatient Database was performed. Neonates discharged/died with a diagnosis of
      HLH were identified and analyzed. Results: Among 11,130,055 discharges, 76
      neonates had a diagnosis of HLH. Fifty-two percent (95% CI: 38.6-63.6) were males
      and 54% (95% CI: 39.7-68.5) were white. Herpes simplex infection was present in
      16% (95% CI: 9.2-28.1). 24.4% (95% CI: 14.5-37.9) received chemotherapy, 11.5%
      (95% CI: 5.2-23.6) IVIG and 3.6% (95% CI: 0.8-14.4) allogenic hemopoietic stem
      cell transplantation. Organ dysfunction was commonly seen and severe sepsis was
      documented in 26.6% (95% CI: 16.4-39.9). Median LOS was 16 (IQR 7-54) days. The
      mortality was 42% (95% CI: 30.8-55). Conclusions: HLH is a rare diagnosis and
      carries a high mortality in neonates. Herpes simplex virus is the most common
      infection associated with neonatal HLH. HLH should be considered in the
      differential diagnosis in neonates presenting with multi-organ dysfunction or
      sepsis.

TI  - Etiological Surveillance of Genital Ulcer Syndrome in South Africa: 2019 to 2020.
PG  - 571-575
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been the leading cause of genital
      ulcer syndrome (GUS) in South Africa for more than a decade, and acyclovir
      therapy is incorporated into syndromic management guidelines. We conducted
      surveillance at 3 sentinel sites to define the common sexually transmitted
      etiologies of GUS and to determine whether current syndromic management is
      appropriate. Secondary objectives of surveillance were to determine the
      seroprevalence of coinfections (HIV, syphilis, HSV-2) in persons presenting with 
      GUS. METHODS: Consecutive, consenting adult men and women presenting with visible
      genital ulceration were enrolled between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. 
      Genital ulcer swab and blood specimens were collected and transported to a
      central sexually transmitted infection reference laboratory in Johannesburg.
      RESULTS: Among 190 participants with GUS, HSV-2 was the most frequently detected 
      ulcer pathogen (49.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41.9%-56.1%). The relative
      prevalence of the second most common ulcer-derived pathogen, Treponema pallidum, 
      was 26.3% (95% CI, 20.5%-33.1%), with 90% of primary syphilis cases having a
      positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer. Male sex was independently associated
      with primary syphilis compared with herpetic ulcers, after adjusting for the
      effect of casual sex partners and other exposures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.53; 95%
      CI, 1.35-9.21; P = 0.010). The overall HIV prevalence among participants was
      41.3% (78 of 189; 95% CI, 34.2%-48.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Herpes simplex virus 2
      remains the predominant cause of GUS, justifying the continued use of acyclovir
      in syndromic guidelines. Adequate supplies of benzathine penicillin G for
      syphilis treatment are essential at primary health care level, in addition to the
      provision of syphilis and HIV risk reduction services.

PG  - 560-564
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001647 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In South Africa, male urethritis syndrome (MUS) is the most common
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndrome in men. We determined the
      distribution of STI etiologies and the susceptibility profiles of Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae isolates from men presenting with MUS to 3 sentinel surveillance
      health care facilities. Secondary objectives were to determine the seroprevalence
      of coinfections (HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus 2). METHODS: Consecutive,
      consenting men with symptomatic urethral discharge were enrolled between January 
      1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Genital discharge swab and blood specimens were
      collected and transported to a central STI reference laboratory in Johannesburg, 
      South Africa. RESULTS: Among 769 men enrolled, N. gonorrhoeae was the commonest
      cause of MUS (674 [87.8%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.2%-89.9%), followed
      by Chlamydia trachomatis (161 [21.0%]; 95% CI, 18.2%-24.0%). Of 542 cultivable N.
      gonorrhoeae isolates, all were susceptible to ceftriaxone (modal minimum
      inhibitory concentration, 0.004 mg/L) and azithromycin (modal minimum inhibitory 
      concentration, 0.128 mg/L). Seroprevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2 were
      21.4% (95% CI, 18.5%-24.5%), 2.3%, and 50.1%, respectively. Condom use at last
      sexual encounter was reported by only 7%, less than 50% had been medically
      circumcised, and only 66.7% (58 of 87) who self-reported an HIV-positive status
      were adherent on antiretroviral drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. 
      trachomatis were the predominant causes of MUS. Currently recommended dual
      ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy are appropriate for MUS syndromic
      management; however, surveillance must be maintained to timeously detect emerging
      and increasing gonococcal resistance. Clinic-based interventions must be
      intensified in men seeing sexual health care to reduce the community transmission
      and burden of STI and HIV.

TI  - Z-DNA binding protein 1 mediates necroptotic and apoptotic cell death pathways in
      murine astrocytes following herpes simplex virus-1 infection.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02469-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which glia respond to viral central nervous system 
      (CNS) pathogens are now becoming apparent with the demonstration that microglia
      and astrocytes express an array of pattern recognition receptors that include
      intracellular RNA and DNA sensors. We have previously demonstrated that glia
      express Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and showed that this cytosolic nucleic
      acid sensor contributes to the inflammatory/neurotoxic responses of these cells
      to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). However, the relative contribution made by
      ZBP1- to HSV-1-mediated cell death in glia has not been determined. METHODS: We
      have investigated the relative contribution made by ZBP1- to HSV-1-mediated cell 
      death in primary astrocytes derived from mice genetically deficient in this
      sensor. We have used capture ELISAs and immunoblot analysis to assess
      inflammatory cytokine production and ZBP1 and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase
      domain-like protein (MLKL) expression levels, respectively, following HSV-1
      challenge. Furthermore, we have used a commercially available cell viability
      assay to determine the proportion and rate of cell death in cells following
      infection with laboratory and neuroinvasive clinical strains of HSV-1, and
      pharmacological inhibitors of necroptotic and apoptotic pathway components to
      assess the relative role of each. RESULTS: We show that the loss of ZBP1 in
      astrocytes results in an increase in the number of viral particles released
      following HSV-1 infection. Importantly, we have confirmed that HSV-1 induces
      necroptosis in astrocytes and have established the ability of ZBP1 to mediate
      this cell death pathway. Interestingly, while ZBP1 is best known for its role in 
      necroptotic signaling, our findings indicate that this sensor can also contribute
      to virally induced apoptosis in these glia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate
      that ZBP1 serves as a restriction factor for HSV-1 infection and is associated
      with the induction of both necroptotic and apoptotic cell death pathways in
      primary murine astrocytes. While it remains to be seen whether ZBP1-mediated
      activation of cell death in astrocytes contributes significantly to host
      protection or, rather, exacerbates HSV-1 encephalitis pathology, the
      identification of such a role in resident CNS cells may represent a novel target 
      for therapeutic intervention to reduce HSV encephalitis-associated morbidity and 
      mortality.

AB  - The development of vaccines against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV1 
      and HSV-2) is an important goal for global health. In this review we reexamined
      (i) the status of ocular herpes vaccines in clinical trials; and (ii) discusses
      the recent scientific advances in the understanding of differential immune
      response between HSV infected asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals that form 
      the basis for the new combinatorial vaccine strategies targeting HSV; and (iii)
      shed light on our novel "asymptomatic" herpes approach based on protective immune
      mechanisms in seropositive asymptomatic individuals who are "naturally" protected
      from recurrent herpetic diseases. We previously reported that phenotypically and 
      functionally distinct HSV-specific memory CD8(+) T cell subsets in asymptomatic
      and symptomatic HSV-infected individuals. Moreover, a better protection induced
      following a prime/pull vaccine approach that consists of first priming anti-viral
      effector memory T cells systemically and then pulling them to the sites of virus 
      reactivation (e.g., sensory ganglia) and replication (e.g., eyes and vaginal
      mucosa), following mucosal administration of vectors expressing T cell-attracting
      chemokines. In addition, we reported that a combination of prime/pull vaccine
      approach with approaches to reverse T cell exhaustion led to even better
      protection against herpes infection and disease. Blocking PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT
      and/or TIM-3 immune checkpoint pathways helped in restoring the function of
      antiviral HSV-specific CD8(+) T cells in latently infected ganglia and increased 
      efficacy and longevity of the prime/pull herpes vaccine. We discussed that a
      prime/pull vaccine strategy that use of asymptomatic epitopes, combined with
      immune checkpoint blockade would prove to be a successful herpes vaccine
      approach.

AB  - Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a herpes virus with a high seropositivity rate among 
      the adult population throughout the world. Primary EBV infection is usually
      asymptomatic among young children. As age increases, it begins to manifest as
      infectious mononucleosis. Gastrointestinal involvement is often mild and
      elevations in liver function tests are common in most cases. Here, we report a
      case of acute acalculous cholecystitis in a 15-year girl during the course of a
      primary EBV infection which is a very rare presentation in the pediatric
      population. Our patient recovered without any antibiotic or surgical treatment - 
      parallel to the clinical improvement of the primary disease. Key Words:
      Epstein-barr virus (EBV) infection, Acute acalculous cholecystitis, Children,
      Antibiotics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is less clinical data on multiple myeloma (MM) in China, and
      the aim of this study was to collect and analyze the clinical data of newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients in Hunan Province during 1 year, to
      understand the real clinical features and treatment outcome for Hunan Province
      patients with MM, and to strengthen the understanding of the standardized
      diagnosis process and treatment plan of MM. METHODS: The clinical data of 529
      patients with NDMM in 12 large-scale general hospitals in Hunan Province from
      January 1 to December 31, 2019 were collected and analyzed, including baseline
      data, treatment regimens, duration of treatment, and adverse reactions. The
      clinical characteristics, treatment, and safety of patients were analyzed by SPSS
      21.0. RESULTS: Among the 529 NDMM patients, the age was 33-90 (median 64) years
      and the male-female ratio was 1.381. The clinical features ranged from high to
      low were as follows: Bone pain (77.7%), anemia (66.8%), renal insufficiency
      (40.6%), hypercalcemia (15.1%). Typing: IgG 46.5%, IgA 24.6%, IgD 2.6%, IgM 0.8%,
      light chain 15.7%, double clone 3.0%, no secretion 0.6%, absence 6.2%. Staging:
      Durie-Salmon stage I, II, and III were 4.5%, 10.6%, 77.3%, respectively, and 40
      cases (7.6%) missed this data. International Staging System (ISS) stage I, II,
      and III were 10.4%, 24.4%, and 47.6%, respectively, and 93 cases (17.6%) were
      missing. Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stage I, II, and III were
      5.5%, 27.0%, 23.1%, respectively, and 235 cases (44.4%) missed this data. Among
      the 98 NDMM patients in the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University,
      Durie-Salmon (DS) stage missing 2.0%, ISS stage missing 12.3%, and R-ISS stage
      missing 12.3%.Treatment: Among the 529 patients,475 received treatment, the rate 
      of treatment was 89.8%; 67.4% of the patients were able to complete four courses 
      of chemotherapy at induction phase, 90.3% of the patients received proteasome
      inhibitor based combination chemotherapy regimen more than once, 67.2% received
      immunomodulator based regimen more than once, and 59.8% of the patients received 
      proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulator based combination chemotherapy regimen
      more than once. Curative: Overall response rate (ORR) and high quality response
      rate (HQR) of the 4-course group were better than those of the 2-course group
      (ORR: 85% vs 65%, P=0.006; HQR: 68.3% vs 24.0%, P<0.001). The HQR of the standard
      chemotherapy group was better than that of the non-standard chemotherapy group
      (65.1% vs 48.2%, P=0.035). Adverse reactions during treatment included
      hematologic toxicity (17.5%), peripheral neuropathy (24.8%), gastrointestinal
      adverse events (23.8%), pulmonary infection (25.9%), herpes zoster (4.6%), and
      venous thrombotic events (1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In 2019, the missed diagnosis rate 
      of MM patients was high, the medium age of diagnosis was older, and the accuracy 
      of patient diagnosis was not high. There is a great difference among medical
      centers, especially in the stage and risk stratified, nearly half of NDMM
      patients are not diagnosed with R-ISS stage; the lack of cytogenetic data needs
      to be supplemented by follow-up studies. A high proportion of patients with NDMM 
      present with bone pain and anemia.Patients received treatment have higher use of 
      chemotherapy regimens containing proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulators,
      but there is a significant gap among different medical centers, and standardized 
      treatment needs to be strengthened. The safety during chemotherapy is
      controllable.

AB  - Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare angiogenic tumor.
      Histologically, the morphological characteristics of neoplastic vessels and
      endothelial differentiation are not obvious, and it is easy to be confused with
      epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and myogenic tumor. PHE
      usually occurs in arms and legs in young people and has a significant male
      predominance. The tumor has a predilection for the distal extremities and its
      typical manifestation is multiple center invasion of a single limb, which can
      involve all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues,and is often accompanied by
      abvious pain. Histologically, PHE is characterized by infiltrative growth of
      tumor. Most tumor lesions are composed of sheets and loose fascicles of plump
      spindle or epithelioid cells within a background of variably prominent
      inflammatory infiltration, which was commonly composed of neutrophils. Some cells
      may resemble rhabdomyoblasts, and nuclear atypia and mitosis were rare. The tumor
      cells generally expressed positive cytokeratin (CK), ETS-related gene (ERG),
      Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) and integrase interactor 1(INI1). In
      some cases, the tumor cells expressed CD31. A case of a young woman was reported 
      in this paper, who presented with a subcutaneous mass with severe pain and was
      chronologically misdiagnosed with herpes zoster, low-grade malignant fibrous
      histiocytoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. In this study, the clinical
      and pathological features, differential diagnosis and the latest progress in
      therapy of PHE were analyzed based on relevant literature.

AB  - The presence and abundance of viral proteins within host cells are part of the
      essential signatures of the cellular stages of viral infections. However, methods
      that can comprehensively detect and quantify these proteins are still limited,
      particularly for viruses with large protein coding capacity. Here, we design and 
      experimentally validate a mass spectrometry-based Targeted herpesviRUS proTEin
      Detection (TRUSTED) assay for monitoring human viruses representing the three
      Herpesviridae subfamilies-herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus
      (HCMV), and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. We demonstrate assay
      applicability for (1) capturing the temporal cascades of viral replication, (2)
      detecting proteins throughout a range of virus concentrations and in in vivo
      models of infection, (3) assessing the effects of clinical therapeutic agents and
      sirtuin-modulating compounds, (4) studies using different laboratory and clinical
      viral strains, and (5) discovering a role for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 in
      supporting HCMV replication.

AB  - The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier
      to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals
      modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic
      suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon
      (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was
      dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria
      interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria
      activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host 
      cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and
      promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA
      (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this
      study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING
      activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections.
      Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral
      infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze data from children who were previously healthy and
      presented with post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke upon arrival when admitted
      to the emergency room, with focus on the clinical/laboratory aspects, and
      neurocognitive performance after four-year follow-up. METHODS: Seven children
      presenting with arterial ischemic stroke after varicella were evaluated at
      pediatric emergency services in the city of Sao Paulo (SP), Brazil. Ischemic
      stroke was determined by magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance
      angiography in a topography compatible with the areas supplied by the middle
      cerebral or internal carotid arteries. IgG-class antibodies against varicella
      zoster virus and varicella-zoster virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in
      cerebrospinal fluid were tested. Patients with prothrombotic conditions were
      excluded. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure was applied upon admission and
      4-years after the stroke. RESULTS: All patients (age range: 1.3 to 4 years)
      included presented chickenpox 5.1 (+/-3.5) months before. All patients had
      analysis of anti-varicella-zoster-virus-IgG in cerebrospinal fluid, but only
      three (43%) had a positive result. Of the patients 43% had no vascular lesions
      identified in magnetic resonance angiography. All patients showed improvement in 
      their sequela scores. After 4 years, five patients displayed good evolution in
      the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure, and only one patient presented with a score
      of 2 in the sensorimotor and cognition areas. No recurrence of arterial ischemic 
      stroke was observed. CONCLUSION: We reinforced the non-progressive course of
      post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke after 4-year follow-up. The presence of
      varicella-zoster-virus-DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction, and/or
      intrathecal IgG antibody against varicella zoster virus, and angiopathy location 
      in magnetic resonance angiography were not determining for the diagnosis.
      Invasive tests, with low sensitivity, should be well considered in the diagnosis 
      of post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke.

TI  - UXT attenuates the CGAS-STING1 signaling by targeting STING1 for autophagic
      degradation.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2022.2076192 [doi]
AB  - STING1 (stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1), the pivotal
      adaptor protein of CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-STING1 signaling, is critical
      for type I IFN production of innate immunity. However, excessive or prolonged
      activation of STING1 is associated with autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      Thus, preventing STING1 from over-activation is important to maintain immune
      homeostasis. Here, we reported that UXT (ubiquitously expressed prefoldin like
      chaperone), a small chaperone-like protein, was essential to prevent the
      excessive activation of STING1-mediated type I IFN signaling through autophagic
      degradation of STING1 via SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1). Upon DNA mimics or cyclic
      GMP-AMP (cGAMP) stimulation, UXT specifically interacted with STING1 and promoted
      STING1 degradation through selective macroautophagy/autophagy. Moreover, UXT was 
      required for more efficient autophagic degradation of STING1 by facilitating the 
      interaction of SQSTM1 and STING1. The in vivo role of UXT in attenuating the
      CGAS-STING1 signaling was further confirmed in the mouse model of DNA-virus
      infection and the TMPD (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane)-induced murine lupus
      model. Intriguingly, the expression of UXT was consistently impaired and
      exhibited a remarkable inverse correlation with type I IFN signature in the
      leukocytes and PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of several large SLE
      (systemic lupus erythematosus) cohorts. Importantly, the replenishment of UXT
      effectively suppressed the production of IFNs and ISGs in the PBMCs of SLE
      patients. Taken together, our study reveals a novel regulatory role of UXT in
      autophagic degradation of STING1 to maintain immune homeostasis. UXT might be a
      potential therapeutic target for alleviating aberrant type I IFNs in autoimmune
      diseasesAbbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; BMDMs: bone marrow-derived

TI  - Screening of Key Part in IFN Pathway for Herpes Zoster: Evidence from
      Bioinformatics Analysis.
LID - 10.2174/1386207325666220509182242 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster is one of the most common diseases in the middle and
      old ages, and the incidence rate is constantly increasing. Long-term, severe
      neuropathological pain continues to afflict the patients, causing them horrible
      pain, and even unable to live a normal life. Since the occurrence and development
      of herpes zoster is related to many mechanisms, there is no uniform conclusion
      and specific treatment method, and the HZ vaccine still has a limited number of
      people to be vaccinated. OBJECTIVE: It is still worth exploring the potential
      mechanism or biomarkers for Herpes zoster. METHOD: In this study, a data set
      GSE165112 containing 12 samples was downloaded, of which 6 samples were treated
      with interferon and 6 samples were not treated. Differentially expressed genes
      (DEG) analysis, KEGG, GO enrichment analysis and GSEA were carried out. RESULTS: 
      A total of 264 DEGs were identified, including 32 up-regulated DEGs and 232
      down-regulated DEGs. DEGs are mainly enriched in immune response, inflammatory
      response, chemotaxis, etc. There are 4 key pathways related to HZ closely,
      includes IL2-STAT5 signaling, Inflammatory response, TNF-a signaling via
      NF-kappaB and IFN-alpha. And we also identified 10 hub genes. CONCLUSION: This
      study shows that exploring DEGs and pathways through bioinformatics analysis is
      of great significance for understanding the molecular mechanism of HZ, especially
      in the defect of IFN pathway. These parts may helpful to improve the treatment
      for HZ.

TI  - Health impact of seven herpesviruses on (pre)diabetes incidence and HbA1c:
      results from the KORA cohort.
PG  - 1328-1338
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05704-7 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide, and
      previous studies have suggested that it is higher in individuals who are
      seropositive for herpesviruses. This study examines the prospective association
      of herpesviruses with (pre)diabetes to evaluate their potential role in diabetes 
      aetiology. METHODS: Two follow-up examinations of the German population-based
      KORA cohort (F4 and FF4) were used to identify participants with normal glucose
      tolerance at baseline, thus being at risk for (pre)diabetes (n = 1257). All
      participants had repeated OGTTs and antibody measurements for herpes simplex
      virus (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus 
      (CMV) and human herpesvirus 6 and 7. Regression models were used to evaluate the 
      association between serostatus with (pre)diabetes incidence after a 7 year
      follow-up and HbA1c. RESULTS: HSV2 and CMV were associated with (pre)diabetes
      incidence after adjustment for sex, age, BMI, education, smoking, physical
      activity, parental diabetes, hypertension, lipid levels, insulin resistance and
      fasting glucose. Seropositivity of both viruses was also cross-sectionally
      associated with higher HbA1c at baseline, with the association of HSV2 being
      independent of confounders, including the prevalence of (pre)diabetes itself.
      While seropositivity for multiple herpesviruses was associated with a higher
      incidence of (pre)diabetes, this association was not independent of confounders. 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The associations of HSV2 and CMV serostatus with
      (pre)diabetes incidence indicate that these herpesviruses may contribute to the
      development of impaired glucose metabolism. Our results highlight the link
      between viral infection and (pre)diabetes, and the need for more research
      evaluating viral prevention strategies.

PG  - 433
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03400-1 [doi]
AB  - The DNA sensor cGAS detects cytosolic DNA and instigates type I interferon (IFN) 
      expression. Recent studies find that cGAS also localizes in the nucleus and binds
      the chromatin. Despite the mechanism controlling nuclear cGAS activation is well 
      elucidated, whether nuclear cGAS participates in DNA sensing is unclear. Here, we
      report that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection caused the release of cGAS
      from the chromatin into the nuclear soluble fraction. Like its cytosolic
      counterpart, the leaked nuclear soluble cGAS also sensed viral DNA, produced
      cGAMP, and induced mRNA expression of type I IFN and interferon-stimulated genes.
      Consistently, the nuclear soluble cGAS limited HSV-1 infection. Furthermore,
      enzyme-deficient mutation (D307A) or cGAS inhibitor RU.251 abolished nuclear
      cGAS-mediated innate immune responses, suggesting that enzymatic activity is also
      required for nuclear soluble cGAS. Taken all together, our study demonstrates
      that nuclear soluble cGAS acts as a nuclear DNA sensor detecting
      nuclear-replicating DNA viruses.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can cause
      life-altering and debilitating cognitive decline. AD's etiology is poorly
      understood, and no disease-modifying therapeutics exist. Here, we describe the
      use of 2D and 3D tissue culture models of herpesvirus-induced AD, which
      recapitulate hallmark disease features of plaque formation, gliosis,
      neuroinflammation, and impaired neuronal signaling, to screen a panel of 21
      medications, supplements, and nutraceuticals with purported neuroprotective
      benefits. This screen identified green tea catechins and resveratrol as having
      strong anti-plaque properties, functional neuroprotective benefits, and minimal
      neurotoxicity, providing support for their further investigation as AD
      preventives and therapies. Two other candidates, citicoline and metformin,
      reduced plaque formation and were minimally toxic, but did not protect against
      virus-induced impairments in neuronal signaling. This study establishes a simple 
      platform for rapidly screening and characterizing AD compounds of interest in 2D 
      and 3D human cortical tissue models representing physiologically relevant disease
      features.

TI  - Comorbidities of systemic lupus erythematosus prior to and following diagnosis in
      different age-at-onset groups.
PG  - 963-973

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a female-dominated autoimmune
      disease that can occur at any age and has a diverse course. The clinical
      manifestation of this disease can vary depending on the patient's age at onset.
      The aim of this study was to characterise the comorbidities at the time of SLE
      diagnosis and after in different age groups. METHODS: A total 1042 incident cases
      of SLE with a Catastrophic Illness Card in 2005 and 10,420 age- and sex-matched
      controls from the general population registered in the National Health Insurance 
      Research Database in Taiwan were enrolled in the study. The risk of comorbidities
      before (adjusted odds ratio, [aOR]) and after (adjusted hazard ratio, [aHR]) of
      SLE was analysed. The burden of these SLE-associated comorbidities was weight by 
      the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We used the cumulative incidence to
      evaluate the impact of comorbidities on different age onset groups. RESULTS: In
      this study, musculoskeletal diseases had the highest positive association (aOR,
      5.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.25-6.57) prior to the diagnosis of SLE and 
      they were also the most common developing incident comorbidity after the
      diagnosis (HR, 13.7; 95% CI: 11.91-15.77). It only took less than 1 year for 50% 
      of the late-onset SLE patients to develop any increase in CCI score. The
      developing comorbidities attributed to 16.3% all-cause mortality and they had the
      greatest impact on late-onset SLE patients, with 33.3% cumulative incidence to
      all-cause mortality. There is no difference in the incidence of infectious
      diseases across different age groups. The herpes zoster infection had the
      greatest cumulative incidence among the category of infection diseases in
      child-onset SLE patients. CONCLUSION: SLE patients had increased risks of
      multiple pre-existing comorbidities at diagnosis. The developed comorbidity after
      diagnosis could contribute to all-cause mortality. The herpes zoster infection is
      primarily an issue in child-onset SLE patients.

AB  - Neuraxial opioids are well known to cause itching, which may be challenging to
      treat. Neuraxial morphine has been demonstrated to cause recrudescent herpes
      simplex viruses (HSV-1), especially in women during labor and childbirth with
      neuraxial analgesia, and may be an occult etiology of refractory itching. This
      educational review summaries the clinical and epidemiological characteristics
      associated with recrudescent HSV-1 in patients treated with neuraxial opioids,
      especially morphine.

      Health.
PG  - 523-525
LID - 10.36849/JDD.6179 [doi]
AB  - Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin conditions. AD
      is generally characterized by eczematous and pruritic skin lesions, although it
      can present differently between individuals. There are multiple comorbidities for
      AD, including asthma, food allergies, and ocular disorders such as
      conjunctivitis. Common treatments for AD include topical corticosteroids,
      calcineurin inhibitors, and injectable biologic medications. However, all these
      medications pose risks that may deter some patients. Ocular risks are associated 
      with use of both topical corticosteroids and biologics, which presents an
      interesting challenge as ocular risks are also comorbidities for AD itself. We
      present a case of one patient&rsquo;s history with severe AD and ocular
      disorders. Since ocular disorders were of great concern to her, she chose to
      treat her eczema conservatively with non-steroidal topical medications. Her
      eczema remained poorly controlled, and she subsequently developed eczema
      herpeticum. Once recovered from eczema herpeticum, she decided to initiate
      biologic treatment. With dupilumab therapy, her eczema cleared promptly and
      revealed to her how much her eczema had compromised her quality of life now that 
      she had accepted the treatment that frightened her for many years. J Drugs

      Silver-Containing Nanocomposites Based on Polylactic Acid-Chitosan.

AB  - Antimicrobial and antiviral nanocomposites based on polylactic acid (PLA) and
      chitosan were synthesized by a thermochemical reduction method of Ag(+) ions in
      the PLA-Ag(+)-chitosan polymer films. Features of the structural, morphological, 
      thermophysical, antimicrobial, antiviral, and cytotoxic properties of
      PLA-Ag-chitosan nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
      thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and antiviral, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic
      studies. The effects of temperature and the duration of reduction of Ag(+) ions
      on the structure of PLA-Ag-chitosan nanocomposites were established. During the
      thermochemical reduction (T = 160 degrees C, t = 5 min) of silver palmitate ions 
      in PLA-Ag(+)-chitosan polymer films, Ag nanoparticles with an average size of 4.2
      nm were formed. PLA-Ag-chitosan polymer nanocomposites have strong antimicrobial 
      activity against S. aureus and E. coli strains. In particular, for PLA-chitosan
      samples containing 4% Ag, the diameters of the S. aureus and E. coli growth
      inhibition zones were 25.8 and 25.0 mm, respectively. The antiviral activity of
      the nanocomposites against influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and
      adenovirus serotype 2 was also revealed. The PLA-4%Ag-chitosan nanocomposites
      completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) of herpes virus type 1 by 5.12
      log10TCID50/mL (high antiviral activity) and the development of the CPE of
      influenza virus and adenovirus by 0.60 and 1.07 log10TCID50/mL (relative
      antiviral activity). The obtained nanocomposites were not cytotoxic; they did not
      inhibit the viability of MDCK, BHK-21, and Hep-2 cell cultures.

LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.845580 [doi]
AB  - A growing body of epidemiological and research data has associated neurotropic
      viruses with accelerated brain aging and increased risk of neurodegenerative
      disorders. Many viruses replicate optimally in senescent cells, as they offer a
      hospitable microenvironment with persistently elevated cytosolic calcium,
      abundant intracellular iron, and low interferon type I. As cell-cell fusion is a 
      major driver of cellular senescence, many viruses have developed the ability to
      promote this phenotype by forming syncytia. Cell-cell fusion is associated with
      immunosuppression mediated by phosphatidylserine externalization that enable
      viruses to evade host defenses. In hosts, virus-induced immune dysfunction and
      premature cellular senescence may predispose to neurodegenerative disorders. This
      concept is supported by novel studies that found postinfectious cognitive
      dysfunction in several viral illnesses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1,
      herpes simplex virus-1, and SARS-CoV-2. Virus-induced pathological syncytia may
      provide a unified framework for conceptualizing neuronal cell cycle reentry,
      aneuploidy, somatic mosaicism, viral spreading of pathological Tau and
      elimination of viable synapses and neurons by neurotoxic astrocytes and
      microglia. In this narrative review, we take a closer look at cell-cell fusion
      and vesicular merger in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We
      present a "decentralized" information processing model that conceptualizes
      neurodegeneration as a systemic illness, triggered by cytoskeletal pathology. We 
      also discuss strategies for reversing cell-cell fusion, including, TMEM16F
      inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, senolytics, and tubulin stabilizing agents.
      Finally, going beyond neurodegeneration, we examine the potential benefit of
      harnessing fusion as a therapeutic strategy in regenerative medicine.

TI  - Strategies for successful designing of immunocontraceptive vaccines and recent
      updates in vaccine development against sexually transmitted infections - A
      review.
PG  - 2033-2046
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2022.01.006 [doi]
AB  - Background: The world population is continuously growing. It has been estimated
      that half of the world's population is from the Asian continent, mainly from
      China and India. Overpopulation may lead to many societal problems as well as to 
      changes in the habitat. Birth control measures are thus needed to control this
      growth. However, for the last 50-60 years, there have not been any improvements
      in the field of contraception. Nevertheless, the immunocontraceptive vaccine is
      an emerging field, and it might be the only replacement for the existing mode of 
      contraception for the next millennium. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are
      frequent, and their transmission rate increases yearly. As antibiotics are the
      prevailing treatment for this kind of infections, resistance in humans has
      increased; therefore, having effective antibiotic treatments for STIs is now a
      concern. Vaccines against STIs are now needed. It is thought that the
      improvements in the fields of proteomics, immunomics, metabolomics, and other
      omics will help in the successful development of vaccines. Objective: To collect 
      and review the literature about recent advancements in immunocontraception and
      vaccines against sexually transmitted diseases/infections. Methods: Reliable
      scientific databases, such as PubMed Central, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and
      Goggle Scholar, were consulted. Publications bearing important information on
      targeted antigens/immunogens for contraceptive vaccine design and advancements in
      vaccine development for STIs were gathered and tabulated, and details were
      analyzed as per the theme of each study. Results: Important antigens that have a 
      specific role in fertility have been studied extensively for their contraceptive 
      nature. Additionally, the advancements in the screening for the best antigens,
      according to their antigenic nature and how they elicit immune responses for an
      extended period were also studied. Herd immunity for STIs and advancements in the
      development of vaccines for syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes simplex virus were
      also studied and tabulated in this review. An extensive knowledge on STIs
      vaccines was gained. Conclusion: This extensive review is aimed to provide
      insights for active researchers in vaccinology, immunology, and reproductive
      biology. Advancements in the development of vaccines for different STIs can be
      gathered as a wholesome report.

AB  - In developed countries, the main etiology of posterior uveitis is of infectious
      origin, Herpes is the most common viral agent as it has a wide spectral of ocular
      manifestations. These manifestations could depend on the patient's immunologic
      state, ranging from a mild focal form of non-necrotizing herpetic renitis (NNHR) 
      to a severe form of Acute retinal necrosis (ARN). We present a case of NNHR by
      VHS 2 and the different differential diagnostics previous to its diagnosis:
      atypical ocular toxoplasmosis, ocular tuberculosis and ARN. During its evolution,
      it presented a drastic drop in the visual acuity despite of the antiviral
      treatment, and with systemic corticoids and the injury's clinical improvement.
      This event led to reevaluate the suspected entities, establishing the NNHR as a
      definitive diagnostic by exclusion that constituted a challenging diagnostic.

      Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus oncoprotein vFLIP.

AB  - Constitutive activation of the canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a major
      factor in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus pathogenesis where it is
      essential for the survival of primary effusion lymphoma. Central to this process 
      is persistent upregulation of the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) complex by the
      virally encoded oncoprotein vFLIP. Although the physical interaction between
      vFLIP and the IKK kinase regulatory component essential for persistent
      activation, IKKgamma, has been well characterized, it remains unclear how the
      kinase subunits are rendered active mechanistically. Using a combination of
      cell-based assays, biophysical techniques, and structural biology, we demonstrate
      here that vFLIP alone is sufficient to activate the IKK kinase complex.
      Furthermore, we identify weakly stabilized, high molecular weight vFLIP-IKKgamma 
      assemblies that are key to the activation process. Taken together, our results
      are the first to reveal that vFLIP-induced NF-kappaB activation pivots on the
      formation of structurally specific vFLIP-IKKgamma multimers which have an
      important role in rendering the kinase subunits active through a process of
      autophosphorylation. This mechanism of NF-kappaB activation is in contrast to
      those utilized by endogenous cytokines and cellular FLIP homologues.

TI  - [Management and hygiene measures during an outbreak of herpes, influenza,
      strangles or infections with multidrug resistant bacteria].
PG  - 115-125
LID - 10.1055/a-1809-2163 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review is to describe general guidelines of hygiene measures in
      the horse stable as well as to provide current recommendations for an outbreak of
      a common infectious disease. General cleanliness, hand hygiene, avoidance of
      stress, regular deworming, and vaccinations belong to the basic hygiene measures 
      in a horse herd. All new or returning equids should be submitted to a quarantine 
      period as an important prevention measure. Repeated washing and disinfection of
      hands may prevent spreading of infectious agents to people and horses.The
      conception of a hygiene plan, including general biosecurity procedures and
      standard operating procedures in a case of an outbreak of an infectious disease, 
      zoonosis, or colonization with multi-resistant bacteria is strongly recommended. 
      As soon as the disease is suspected, extended hygiene measures including
      protective clothing, cleaning, disinfection, and isolation of potentially
      infected animals should be implemented. Prompt confirmation of the causative
      agent by examination of appropriate samples is crucial. It is important to adjust
      all safety measures based on the contagious nature of the respective pathogen and
      its major transmission routes. Apart from a lock-down of the stable, clinic or
      show grounds, the segregation of horses plays an important role. Implementation
      of the "traffic light system" is recommended. In this, the red group ("infected")
      include animals with clinical signs of the disease or that have been tested
      positive. All horses with possible pathogen contact should be allocated to a
      yellow group ("suspected") and regularly controlled for the signs of infection
      and fever. Clinically normal horses without contact to the infected animals
      belong to the green group ("healthy"). A change of protective clothing and an
      extensive disinfection should be performed when moving between the groups.The
      extended hygiene measures are to be maintained until all animals have been tested
      negative or fail to exhibit clinical signs of the disease for a certain time
      period.

TI  - Covalent Immune Proximity-Induction Strategy Using SuFEx-Engineered Bifunctional 
      Viral Peptides.
PG  - 1269-1281
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.2c00233 [doi]
AB  - Covalent antibody recruiting molecules (cARMs) constitute a proximity-inducing
      chemical strategy to modulate the recognition and elimination of cancer cells by 
      the immune system. Recognition is achieved through synthetic bifunctional
      molecules that use covalency to stably bridge endogenous hapten-specific
      antibodies like anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP), with tumor antigens on cancer cell
      surfaces. To recruit these antibodies, cARMs are equipped with the native
      hapten-binding molecule. The majority of cancer-killing immune machinery,
      however, recognizes epitopes on protein ligands and not small molecule haptens
      (e.g., Fc receptors, pathogen-specific antibodies). To access this broader class 
      of immune machinery for recruitment, we developed a covalent immune
      proximity-inducing strategy. This strategy uses synthetic bifunctional
      electrophilic peptides derived from the native protein ligand. These bifunctional
      peptides are engineered to contain both a tumor-targeting molecule and a sulfonyl
      (VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) electrophile. As a proof of concept, we
      synthesized bifunctional electrophilic peptides derived from glycoprotein D (gD) 
      on herpes simplex virus (HSV), to recruit gD-specific serum anti-HSV antibodies
      to cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). We
      demonstrate that serum anti-HSV antibodies can be selectively and irreversibly
      targeted by these electrophilic peptides and that the reaction rate can be
      uniquely enhanced by tuning SuFEx chemistry without a loss in selectivity. In
      cellular assays, electrophilic peptides demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor
      immunotherapeutic efficacy compared to analogous peptides lacking electrophilic
      functionality. This enhanced efficacy was especially prominent in the context of 
      (a) natural anti-HSV antibodies isolated from human serum and (b) harder to treat
      tumor cells associated with lower PSMA expression levels. Overall, we demonstrate
      a new covalent peptide-based approach to immune proximity induction and reveal
      the potential utility of anti-viral antibodies in synthetic tumor immunotherapy.

      hypothalamus and brainstem.
LID - bjac009 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/chemse/bjac009 [doi]
AB  - Somatostatin neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA/Sst) can be
      parsed into subpopulations that project either to the nucleus of the solitary
      tract (NST) or parabrachial nucleus (PBN). We have shown recently that inhibition
      of CeA/Sst-to-NST neurons increased the ingestion of a normally aversive taste
      stimulus, quinine HCl (QHCl). Because the CeA innervates other forebrain areas
      such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that also sends axonal projections to the
      NST, the effects on QHCl intake could be, in part, the result of CeA modulation
      of LH-to-NST neurons. To address these issues, the present study investigated
      whether CeA/Sst-to-NST neurons are distinct from CeA/Sst-to-LH neurons. For
      comparison purposes, additional experiments assessed divergent innervation of the
      LH by CeA/Sst-to-PBN neurons. In Sst-cre mice, two different retrograde
      transported flox viruses were injected into the NST and the ipsilateral LH or PBN
      and ipsilateral LH. The results showed that 90% or more of retrograde-labeled
      CeA/Sst neurons project either to the LH, NST, or PBN. Separate populations of
      CeA/Sst neurons projecting to these different regions suggest a highly
      heterogeneous population in terms of synaptic target and likely function.

AB  - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe dermatological disease classically
      characterized by erythematous target lesions and mucosal involvement. Fuchs
      syndrome is an incomplete presentation of SJS which has oral, conjunctival and
      genital manifestations but no skin lesions. To the best of our knowledge, our
      case of Fuchs syndrome in an 80-year-old man is the first such case related to
      herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection to be described. Our patient quickly
      recovered following IVIG therapy, although specific treatment is still a topic of
      discussion. Research is required on this poorly understood dermatological disease
      to determine optimum therapy. LEARNING POINTS: We report a case of Fuchs syndrome
      in an elderly man after HSV-1 cheilitis.Therapy always includes discontinuation
      of the causative drug.Specific therapy for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Fuchs
      syndrome is still a topic of discussion, although we noted marked improvement
      following the administration of IVIG therapy.

TI  - Comparative risk of herpes zoster in patients with psoriatic disease on systemic 
      treatments: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 20406223221091188
LID - 10.1177/20406223221091188 [doi]
AB  - Background: Numerous previous studies have examined risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in
      psoriatic disease; however, the results of these studies are conflicting and the 
      relative risks associated with different treatments remain largely unknown. In
      this meta-analysis, we examined the relative risk of HZ associated with systemic 
      treatments for psoriatic disease. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and 
      Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant English-language
      studies published up to April 2021. Data were extracted using a standardized data
      extraction form. Network meta-analyses (NMA) was performed according to Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We 
      examined the differences in HZ risk (incidence rate ratio; IRR) between
      treatments using a random-effects model for direct pairwise comparisons and NMA. 
      The surface under the cumulative ranking area was calculated to rank the HZ risk 
      for each treatment condition. Results: This study analyzed 13 studies including
      19 treatment arms involving a total of 443,104 patients with psoriatic disease.
      Corticosteroids (CS) [IRR, 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.59-4.13], a
      Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi; tofacitinib) (IRR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.03-5.32),
      infliximab (IRR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.27-4.21), conventional synthetic
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) + CS (IRR, 2.26; 95% CI,
      1.23-4.17), anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) + csDMARDs and/or
      CS (IRR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.38-3.31), csDMARDs (IRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.18-2.22), and
      anti-TNF-alpha except infliximab (IRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.13-2.30) were all
      associated with a significantly higher HZ risk compared to controls. CS treatment
      possessed the highest HZ risk, followed by infliximab and JAKi (tofacitinib).
      Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, anti-interleukin-17, -23 or -12/23, phototherapy, 
      and acitretin showed a risk similar to controls without significant differences. 
      Conclusion: The NMA demonstrated CS, infliximab, and JAKi (tofacitinib), and
      several combination treatments were associated with higher HZ risk in patients
      with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Differences in HZ risk should be taken
      into consideration when considering optimal psoriasis treatment.

TI  - "If I don't smoke shisha, I won't be able to sleep": lived experiences of high
      school students in Ethiopia.
LID - 001c.33806 [pii]
LID - 10.29392/001c.33806 [doi]
AB  - Background: Shisha smoking predisposes the users to cardiovascular diseases,
      cancer, and infections, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and herpes. In Ethiopia,
      there is little data on the adolescents' shisha smoking experience. This study
      aimed to explore the lived experience of high school students and inform ongoing 
      and future prevention and control interventions. Methods: This study was
      conducted in Addis Ababa and Adama cities in Ethiopia. Twenty-five secondary
      school students aged 15-22 years who had shisha smoking experience participated
      in this study. A topic guide was used to facilitate the in-depth interviews
      (IDIs) and a digital audio recorder recorded the interviews. Interviews varied
      between 40-90 minutes and were conducted in private open-air spaces where only
      the interviewee and researcher were present. Each transcript was coded using
      Atlas.ti version 8 software. The analytical approach was iterative, with
      interview transcripts analyzed at the time of coding and re-analyzed after a
      preliminary result was drafted to search for additional themes. Results: Students
      described two key factors that influenced their decision to initiate shisha
      smoking: peer influence and perceiving it as a means to release stress. After
      initiating shisha use students maintained the behaviour because of: peer
      influence, khat chewing, enjoyment of shisha smoking, having prolonged leisure
      time, and accessibility to shisha. Students regretted the impact shisha use had
      on their lives, such as conflict with their families, poor academic performance, 
      and spending money on shisha smoking. Female students were also concerned about
      reproductive health risks related to shisha use. Conclusions: Peer influence
      played a major role both in initiating and maintaining shisha use. However,
      students admitted concern over the impact of shisha smoking on academic
      performance and their relationship with their families. Since shisha use is
      associated with khat chewing; shisha smoking control programs cannot be
      successful without controlling khat. Especially young girls had worries about
      their reproductive health risks associated with shisha use. This suggests that
      targeted awareness raising programs highlighting the dangers of shisha use for
      both health and safety; especially for young women is required.

      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.
PG  - e23789
LID - 10.7759/cureus.23789 [doi]
AB  - Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an approved oral pharmacologic agent used in the
      treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Although commonly
      used in clinical practice, its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Some 
      frequent side effects associated with this drug are angioedema, hepatic injury,
      flushing, herpes zoster infection, and abdominal pain among others. A 47-year-old
      female presented with symptoms of an allergic reaction after initiating DMF
      therapy. She required intensive care unit admission due to an acute-hypoxic
      respiratory failure. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed apical
      ballooning and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%-40%. A coronary
      angiogram revealed no coronary artery disease. The diagnosis of takotsubo
      cardiomyopathy was made. The patient was managed with high-dose steroids and an
      epinephrine drip, in addition to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for respiratory
      support. At a three-month follow-up, a repeat TTE showed a resolution of the
      underlying takotsubo cardiomyopathy (CM) with no stunted myocardium and a normal 
      ejection fraction (EF). Here, I highlight a life-threatening case of DMF-induced 
      takotsubo CM and familiarize clinicians and patients with the need for close
      monitoring of symptoms when initiating disease-modifying drug (DMD) therapy.

TI  - Interactome and Ubiquitinome Analyses Identify Functional Targets of Herpes
      Simplex Virus 1 Infected Cell Protein 0.
PG  - 856471
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.856471 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can productively infect multiple cell types and
      establish latent infection in neurons. Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is an HSV-1
      E3 ubiquitin ligase crucial for productive infection and reactivation from
      latency. However, our knowledge about its targets especially in neuronal cells is
      limited. We confirmed that, like in non-neuronal cells, ICP0-null virus exhibited
      major replication defects in primary mouse neurons and Neuro-2a cells. We
      identified many ICP0-interacting proteins in Neuro-2a cells, 293T cells, and
      human foreskin fibroblasts by mass spectrometry-based interactome analysis.
      Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated ICP0 interactions with acyl-coenzyme A
      thioesterase 8 (ACOT8), complement C1q binding protein (C1QBP), ovarian tumour
      domain-containing protein 4 (OTUD4), sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), and vimentin (VIM)
      in both Neuro-2a and 293T cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed 
      that SNX9 restricted replication of an ICP0-null but not wild-type virus in
      Neuro-2a cells. Ubiquitinome analysis by immunoprecipitating the trypsin-digested
      ubiquitin reminant followed by mass spectrometry identified numerous candidate
      ubiquitination substrates of ICP0 in infected Neuro-2a cells, among which OTUD4
      and VIM were novel substrates confirmed to be ubiquitinated by transfected ICP0
      in Neuro-2a cells despite no evidence of their degradation by ICP0. Expression of
      OTUD4 was induced independently of ICP0 during HSV-1 infection. Overexpressed
      OTUD4 enhanced type I interferon expression during infection with the ICP0-null
      but not wild-type virus. In summary, by combining two proteomic approaches
      followed by confirmatory and functional experiments, we identified and validated 
      multiple novel targets of ICP0 and revealed potential restrictive activities of
      SNX9 and OTUD4 in neuronal cells.

AB  - A high percentage of malignant gliomas are infected by human cytomegalovirus
      (HCMV), and the endogenous expression of HCMV genes and their products are found 
      in these tumors. HCMV antigen expression and its implications in gliomagenesis
      have emerged as a promising target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACT)
      strategies in glioblastoma multiforme (GB) patients. Since antigen-specific T
      cells in the tumor microenvironments lack efficient anti-tumor immune response
      due to the immunosuppressive nature of glioblastoma, CMV-specific ACT relies on
      in vitro expansion of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells employing immunodominant HCMV
      antigens. Given the fact that several hurdles remain to be conquered, recent
      clinical trials have outlined the feasibility of CMV-specific ACT prior to tumor 
      recurrence with minimal adverse effects and a substantial improvement in median
      overall survival and progression-free survival. This review discusses the role of
      HCMV in gliomagenesis, disease prognosis, and recent breakthroughs in harnessing 
      HCMV-induced immunogenicity in the GB tumor microenvironment to develop effective
      CMV-specific ACT.

      Case Based Systemic Review.
PG  - 819465
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.819465 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an immune mediated
      life-threatening condition. It is driven by an overactivation of the immune
      system and causes inflammatory tissue damage potentially leading to organ failure
      and death. Primary HLH is caused by genetic mutations, while secondary HLH is
      triggered by external factors. Viral infections are a well-known cause of
      secondary HLH. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus in the herpes family known to
      cause HLH in rare cases. Methods: We report a recent case of CMV-induced HLH,
      followed by a systematic review of described cases of this rare disease entity,
      through a structured search in the medical database PubMed. All articles were
      assessed on a predetermined set of inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 74
      patients (age > 18 years) with CMV-related HLH were identified, 29 men, 42 women,
      and three patients with unspecified gender. Median age was 37.5 years (range
      18-80). Sixty-six patients (88%) had one or more comorbid conditions and 22
      patients (30%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the most frequent
      comorbidity. Forty patients (54%) received some form of immunomodulating
      treatment prior to HLH development. The general treatment approach was in general
      dual, consisting of antiviral treatment and specific immunomodulating HLH
      treatment approaches. Treatment outcome was at 77% survival, while 23% had fatal 
      outcome. Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of early diagnostic
      work up and treatment intervention. Ability to recognize the characteristic
      clinical traits and perform specific HLH diagnostic workup are key factors to
      ensure targeted diagnostic work and treatment intervention for this patient
      group.

      infection.
PG  - 1372-1378
LID - 10.1111/jpc.15992 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Herpes simplex CNS infection is a rare but important cause of neurological
      disability. Long term outcomes after HSV CNS infection in Australia have not yet 
      been fully described. We sought to provide a comprehensive review of HSV CNS
      infection in children using a retrospective 13-year evaluation of statewide
      laboratory and clinical records and a parent survey conducted at least one year
      after the initial infection. METHODS: All positive PCR HSV 1 and 2 results from
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue were obtained from Queensland pathology
      providers for children aged 0-16 years between 1 January 2005 and 31 December
      2017. Clinical data were obtained from patient records and longer-term outcomes
      via parent survey at least 1 year after initial infection. RESULTS: Forty-three
      children were identified over the 13-year period, 17 (39.5%) neonates and 26
      (60.4%) non-neonates. The annual incidence for HSV CNS infection in Queensland
      children aged </=16 years was 0.3/100 000 (95% confidence intervals (CIs):
      0.2-0.4) with neonates at highest risk (incidence 2.5/100 000 live births, 95%
      CI: 1.5-3.9). HSV 1 was the predominant serotype in both neonates and
      non-neonates (9/17, 52.9% neonates and 19/26, 73.1% non-neonates). Seven (16.3%) 
      children died, five (5/17, 29.4% neonates), directly attributable to HSV CNS
      infection (all neonates). Twenty-five (58.1%) had neurological morbidity at
      discharge (9/17 neonates (52.9%) vs. 16/26 (61.5%) non-neonates) and 20/27
      (74.1%) reported long-term neurological morbidity at follow-up (5/9 neonates
      (55.6%) vs. 15/18 non-neonates (83.3%)). Seven children (two neonates and four
      non-neonates) with long-term neurological sequelae had no neurological morbidity 
      identified at discharge. CONCLUSION: Significant long-term neurologic sequelae
      were seen in children with HSV CNS infection even in children with no
      neurological disability identified at discharge from hospital. Careful
      neurodevelopmental follow-up of all children is recommended.

TI  - A novel oncolytic virus induces a regional cytokine storm and safely eliminates
      malignant ascites of colon cancer.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.4772 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given malignant ascites with a terrible prognosis and a unique immune
      microenvironment, our purpose is to evaluate whether oncolytic herpes simplex
      virus type 2(OH2) is able to safely eliminate ascites of colon cancer and through
      which specific mechanism it exerts antitumor immunity. METHODS: We established an
      ascites mice model through intraperitoneal injection of CT26 cells and obtained
      an appropriate dose range for in vivo tests. Efficacy and safety of OH2 were
      detected by weight of ascites, blood routine analysis, histopathological
      examination, and the survival time of mice. The specific mechanism underlying
      antitumor immunity was analyzed by cytometric bead array, flow cytometry, and
      single-cell RNA sequencing. Furthermore, anti-interleukin (IL)-6R antibody
      tocilizumab was synchronously or sequentially delivered with OH2 to explore the
      role of the regional cytokine storm, mainly IL-6 hypersecretion. RESULTS: OH2 was
      able to eliminate ascites and significantly prolong the survival of mice-bearing 
      CT26 tumor cells by intraperitoneal injection, without obvious systemic damage to
      the main organs even though a regional cytokine storm. Hypersecretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, and increased infiltration of CD4+ and
      CD8+ T cells were observed in ascites mice treated by OH2, compared with those
      treated by 5-fluorouracil or nonresponders. Furthermore, the initial-stage
      blocking of the IL-6 pathway was able to considerably suppress antitumor immune
      responses driven by OH2. Surprisingly, we discovered upregulations of the immune 
      checkpoint genes such as Cd274 and Pdcd1 by single-cell RNA sequencing.
      CONCLUSIONS: OH2 could safely eliminate malignant ascites of colon cancer and
      convert the cold immune microenvironment by inducing a remarkably regional
      cytokine storm in ascites, mainly IL-6, in the early stage of antitumor immune
      responses beyond directed oncolytic virotherapy.

TI  - Concurrent Nephrotoxicity and Neurotoxicity Induced by Oral Valacyclovir in a
      Patient With Previously Normal Kidney Function.
PG  - e23693
LID - 10.7759/cureus.23693 [doi]
AB  - Drug-induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are commonly encountered problems
      in clinical practice. We describe a case of concurrent valacyclovir-induced
      nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in a 64-year-old man with no history of renal
      disease who developed acute renal injury and neurological symptoms after he
      received two weeks of the standard dose of oral valacyclovir for herpes zoster
      meningitis. His clinical condition improved significantly after the initiation of
      hemodialysis. Although nephrotoxicity due to intravenous infusion of valacyclovir
      and/or acyclovir is not uncommon, oral valacyclovir therapy is rarely associated 
      with nephrotoxicity in patients with no history of renal insufficiency.
      Additionally, concurrent nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity due to valacyclovir
      and/or acyclovir are rarely reported. Clinicians should be aware of these adverse
      events as immediate recognition and intervention are necessary to prevent
      morbidity.

TI  - Primary Varicella or Herpes Zoster? An Educational Case Report From the Primary
      Care Clinic.
PG  - e23732
LID - 10.7759/cureus.23732 [doi]
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus is a pathogenic virus that can present itself as a primary
      infection or secondary infection, also known as herpes zoster. Recently, there
      has been a re-emergence of this vaccine-preventable disease due to gaps in
      vaccination. Primary varicella in immunocompetent adults is highly uncommon, and 
      it could result in severe complications within this population. Given this
      delicate scenario, family physicians should be well trained to recognize the
      characteristic cutaneous lesions of varicella and dictate adequate management for
      these patients to obtain the best possible outcome and prevent life-threatening
      complications. We present the case of a 43-year-old immunocompetent woman with
      the onset of a generalized pruritic dermatosis characterized primarily by the
      presence of macules, vesicles, and crusts. The patients' lesions were compatible 
      with primary varicella, and serological studies confirmed the diagnosis. Given
      the absence of acute complications in this individual, supportive treatment and
      close follow-up were the therapeutic modalities. This article focuses on the
      educational discussion of the primary differential diagnosis, evaluation for
      possible complications, and management of this uncommon clinical scenario. We
      also reinforce the importance of immunization in preventing re-emergent diseases 
      as a critical element within primary care management.

      prospective study.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study determines the healing time of lesions on different
      locations and the contributing factors to the healing time in patients with
      pemphigus. METHODS: In this prospective study, newly diagnosed patients with
      mucosal lesions were included. A dermatologist evaluated the lesions, disease
      status, side effects and assigned the PDAI. Follow-up visits were conducted
      monthly until the patient reached complete remission and every three months
      thereafter. A Tzanck smear was performed on lesions clinically suspected to be
      herpetic in origin. RESULTS: Sixty patients enrolled in the study with a mean age
      of 45.9 +/- 11.7 years. The buccal lesions took the longest to resolve
      (73[33.5-105.5] days). However, the posterior pharynx lesions showed the shortest
      healing time (20[13.0-25.5] days). The likelihood of improvement in buccal and
      soft palate lesions decreased by 5% and 3% with each additional year of age,
      respectively. Also, the resolution duration of soft palate lesions was
      significantly shorter in female patients than males (median of 24.0 days vs. 38.5
      days). In contrast, lower gingival lesions resolve significantly faster in male
      patients by a median of 9 days. Herpes simplex virus infection increases the
      healing time of lesions by 26 days (median of 55 days vs. 29 days, hazard ratio
      2.62, 95% CI: 1.04-5.92). CONCLUSIONS: Buccal and lower gingival lesions are more
      recalcitrant to treatment, while posterior pharynx lesions heal most rapidly.
      Furthermore, older age was also associated with a lower rate of lesion
      improvement.

TI  - Non-severe burn injury increases cancer incidence in mice and has long-term
      impacts on the activation and function of T cells.
PG  - tkac016
LID - 10.1093/burnst/tkac016 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recent evidence suggests that burn patients are at increased risk of 
      hospital admission for infection, mental health conditions, cardiovascular
      disease and cancer for many years after discharge for the burn injury itself.
      Burn injury has also been shown to induce sustained immune system dysfunction.
      This change to immune function may contribute to the increased risk of chronic
      disease observed. However, the mechanisms that disrupt long-term immune function 
      in response to burn trauma, and their link to long-term morbidity, remain
      unknown. In this study we investigated changes to immune function after burn
      injury using a murine model of non-severe injury. Methods: An established mouse
      model of non-severe burn injury (full thickness burn equivalent to 8% total body 
      surface area) was used in combination with an orthotopic model of B16 melanoma to
      investigate the link between burns and cancer. Considering that CD8(+) T cells
      are important drivers of effective tumour suppression in this model, we also
      investigated potential dysregulation of this immune population using mouse models
      of burn injury in combination with herpes simplex virus infection. Flow cytometry
      was used to detect and quantify cell populations of interest and changes in
      immune function. Results: We demonstrate that 4 weeks after a non-severe burn
      injury, mice were significantly more susceptible to tumour development than
      controls using an orthotopic model of B16 melanoma. In addition, our results
      reveal that CD8(+) T cell expansion, differentiation and memory potential is
      significantly impaired at 1 month post-burn. Conclusions: Our data suggests that 
      CD8(+) T cell-mediated immunity may be dysfunctional for a sustained period after
      even non-severe burn injury. Further studies in patients to validate these
      findings may support clinical intervention to restore or protect immunity in
      patients after burn injury and reduce the increased risk of secondary morbidities
      observed.

TI  - Optimizing Immunization Strategies in Adult Patients With Chronic Liver Disease
      and Liver Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 196-206
AB  - Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant recipients are at 
      increased risk for infections from vaccine-preventable diseases.
      Gastroenterologists and hepatologists should assess patient immunization history,
      and necessary vaccinations should be given as soon as possible. Vaccines
      demonstrate superior immunogenicity when given earlier in the course of liver
      disease and prior to transplant. This article summarizes recommendations from the
      Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for vaccinations in patients with
      CLD and liver transplant recipients, and includes a discussion of the influenza, 
      herpes zoster, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, human papillomavirus, and 
      COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Localized necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis (GLA) is a very rare
      presentation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We are reporting a case
      that required multidisciplinary expertise to confirm the diagnosis and
      effectively treat the patient. Our patient had a recent diagnosis of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and presented with
      hematuria and palpable inguinal lymph nodes. Affirmative diagnosis required a
      core biopsy of the lymph node with immunochemistry staining and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) testing. This case reviews the unusual presentation of an HSV
      infection and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion 
      for infection when treating an immunocompromised patient with persistent
      symptoms.

      pharmacovigilance database.
PG  - 7140
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-10777-w [doi]
AB  - Increasing number of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been approved for chronic
      haematopoietic neoplasms and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. We aimed to assess
      safety of the first three approved JAK inhibitors: ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and
      baricitinib. In this retrospective observational study, pharmacovigilance data
      were extracted from the World Health Organization database. Adverse events are
      classified according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities hierarchy.
      Until February 28, 2021, all Individual Case Safety Reports [ICSRs] with the
      suspected drug ruxolitinib, tofacitinib or baricitinib were included.
      Disproportionality analysis was performed and the information component (IC) was 
      estimated. Adverse events were considered a significant signal if the lower end
      of the 95% credibility interval of the IC (IC025) was positive. We identified
      126,815 ICSRs involving JAK inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and baricitinib 
      were associated with infectious adverse events (IC025 1.7, especially with viral 
      [herpes and influenza], fungal, and mycobacterial infectious disorders);
      musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (IC025 1.1); embolism and
      thrombosis (IC025 0.4); and neoplasms (IC025 0.8, especially malignant skin
      neoplasms). Tofacitinib was associated with gastrointestinal perforation events
      (IC025 1.5). We did not find a significant increase in the reporting of major
      cardiovascular events. We identified significant association between adverse
      events and ruxolitinib, tofacinitib and baricitinib in international
      pharmacovigilance database.

AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial
      photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to topical antiviral
      therapy for the treatment of children having herpetic gingivostomatitis.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 45 individuals (age group 12-18 years) with herpetic
      gingivostomatitis (HG) were divided into three groups on the basis of provision
      of treatment. (a) Group A: topical anti-viral therapy (TAT) (n = 14, mean age =
      17.0 years) (b) Group B: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) (n = 15, mean 
      age =17.7 years) and (c) Group C: topical anti-viral therapy + adjunctive aPDT (n
      = 16, mean age = 18.0 years) respectively. Pain scores [visual analogue scale
      (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)] were assessed and HSV-1 was
      quantified. ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) was used to compute the
      pro-inflammatory cytokine including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The analysis of the mean values and inter group
      comparisons were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test. The Friedman test was used
      to establish the comparison of the changes observed in HSV quantification, pain
      scores, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. ANOVA tests were employed for the
      quantification of differences observed at follow-ups. The assessments for the
      clinical trial were done at baseline, immediate after post-op, two, and four
      weeks, and three and six months respectively. RESULTS: According to the analysis 
      of the data obtained after the clinical assessment, the three groups reported a
      decrease in the pain scores, HSV-1 quantification and levels of the
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, Group C (TAT + aPDT) reported improvement in
      the observed parameters which was statistically significant in comparison to
      Group A (TAT) and Group B (aPDT) respectively. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial
      photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in conjunction with topical antiviral therapy (TAT)
      helped in reducing the pain scores and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in
      herpetic gingivostomatitis among children.

AB  - In our survey for a new antiviral agent, two types of lectin were purified from
      Nostoc muscorum using both ion-exchange and affinity columns chromatography.
      Nostoc muscorum lectins (NMLs) are categorized based on their carbohydrate
      preference. Nostoc muscorum lectin-1(NML-1) exhibited a strict binding
      specificity for complex glycoproteins without linked carbohydrates, and the other
      displayed specificity for alpha- glycosides mannose polymers (NML-2) and was
      classified as a glycoprotein with 16.8% linked carbohydrates. NML-1 displayed a
      single band of 166 kDa on native-PAGE and two bands of 81 kDa and 85 kDa on
      SDS-PAGE, which confirmed the heterodimeric nature of this lectin. While NML-2 is
      a 50 kDa glycoprotein composed of 25 kDa subunits. Physical characterization of
      NML-1 displayed its stability at a higher temperature of 90 degrees C for 5 min
      and over a wide pH range (4-9), while MNL-2 displayed stability up to a
      temperature of 80 degrees C for 25 min and a pH range of 5-8. NML-1 didn't
      require metal ions for agglutination activity, while the activity of NML-2 was
      doubled by manganese ions. The antiviral activity of two lectins was assessed
      against herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) using a plaque assay which revealed that
      NML-1 inhibited HSV-1 infection at an early stage in contrast to NML-2 which
      exerted its antiviral effect at the late stage of infection. These results
      suggest that Nostoc muscorum is a unique lead for antiviral drug discovery as it 
      is a novel source for antiviral lectins with different modes of action.

TI  - Characteristics of herpes zoster infection in patients with COVID-19: a
      systematic scoping review.
LID - 10.1111/ijd.16221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is literature reporting correlations between varicella
      zoster virus (VZV) infections and COVID-19, insufficient evidence exists in this 
      regard. This scoping review aims to identify the existing evidence regarding
      clinical characteristics of primary VZV infection or reactivation in COVID-19.
      METHODS: Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, MEDLINE and EMBASE
      were searched for all peer-reviewed articles with relevant keywords including
      "Zoster," "Herpes," and "COVID-19" from their inception to November 20, 2021.
      RESULTS: A total of 19 articles with three observational studies and 16 case
      reports or series were included. Primary VZV infections or reactivation were
      observed in 25 patients. Forty-eight percent of the patients had disseminated VZV
      infection. The median time of VZV-related rash after the onset of respiratory
      symptoms was 7.0 days (interquartile range: 0-18.8). Those with COVID-19 and
      primary VZV infection or reactivation had low lymphocyte counts with a median of 
      0.67 x 10(3) /mul. CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified uncertainty and a
      lack of strong evidence to see the association between primary VZV infection or
      reactivation and COVID-19. However, those with COVID-19 may be more likely to
      have disseminated VZV, which poses an additional challenge from an infection
      prevention standpoint. Future studies are warranted to determine the association 
      between primary VZV infection or reactivation and long-term consequences related 
      to COVID-19.

TI  - MARCH8 attenuates cGAS-mediated innate immune responses through ubiquitylation.
PG  - eabk3067
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.abk3067 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binds to microbial and self-DNA in the cytosol and
      synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon
      genes (STING) and downstream mediators to elicit an innate immune response.
      Regulation of cGAS activity is essential for immune homeostasis. Here, we
      identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (also known as MARCHF8, c-MIR, and
      RNF178) as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated signaling. The immune response
      to double-stranded DNA was attenuated by overexpression of MARCH8 and enhanced by
      knockdown or knockout of MARCH8. MARCH8 interacted with the enzymatically active 
      core of cGAS through its conserved RING-CH domain and catalyzed the lysine-63
      (K63)-linked polyubiquitylation of cGAS at Lys(411). This polyubiquitylation
      event inhibited the DNA binding ability of cGAS, impaired cGAMP production, and
      attenuated the downstream innate immune response. Furthermore, March8-deficient
      mice were less susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to herpes simplex
      virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism underlying
      the functional regulation of cGAS and the fine-tuning of the innate immune
      response.

TI  - Dupilumab Provides Acceptable Safety and Sustained Efficacy for up to 4 Years in 
      an Open-Label Study of Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis.
PG  - 393-408
LID - 10.1007/s40257-022-00685-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) often requires long-term
      management with systemic therapies. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the
      safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment up to 4 years in adults with
      moderate-to-severe AD and efficacy in a subgroup of patients who transitioned
      from dupilumab once-weekly (qw) to administration every other week (q2w).
      METHODS: This interim analysis of the open-label extension study (NCT01949311)
      evaluated dupilumab 300 mg qw or q2w in adults previously enrolled in dupilumab
      trials for moderate-to-severe AD. Patients switched from qw to q2w following
      protocol amendment. The primary outcome was safety; efficacy was also assessed.
      RESULTS: Of 2677 patients enrolled and treated, 352 (13.1%) completed week 204
      (end of efficacy assessments) and 202 (7.5%) completed safety follow-up through
      week 244. Self-reported compliance was 98.1%. Dupilumab's safety profile was
      consistent with previous reports. Common treatment-emergent adverse events
      (>/=5%) included nasopharyngitis, AD, upper respiratory tract infection, oral
      herpes, conjunctivitis, injection-site reaction, and headache. At week 204, mean 
      +/- standard deviation (SD) Eczema Area and Severity Index was 2.46 +/- 3.98, and
      mean percent change from parent study baseline (PSBL) was -91.07%; mean +/- SD
      Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score was 2.10 +/- 1.83, and mean percent change 
      from PSBL was -68.74%. Efficacy was maintained in patients (n = 226) who
      transitioned from qw to q2w dosing. Limitations of this study included its
      open-label design, the lack of control arm, and smaller subsets of patients at
      later timepoints and receiving the approved q2w regimen. CONCLUSION: These
      results support dupilumab as continuous long-term treatment for adults with
      moderate-to-severe AD; efficacy was sustained following transition from qw to q2w
      dosing. TRIAL REGISTRATION CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT01949311.

OAB - Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease associated with inflamed skin and
      intense itching. People with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis often need
      long-term treatment, but many available treatments do not have demonstrated
      long-term safety data. In multiple clinical trials, dupilumab treatment resulted 
      in significant improvements in signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. This
      study examined the safety and efficacy of up to 4 years of dupilumab treatment in
      adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, and whether dupilumab continued
      to be effective in patients who switched from receiving treatment each week to
      treatment every other week. To address these questions, we collected data from
      adults who received 300 milligrams of dupilumab every week or every other week.
      In this study, safety findings were consistent with the known dupilumab safety
      profile. Patients' signs and symptoms were evaluated before and during treatment 
      with evaluation tools including the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), which 
      indicates the extent and severity of disease, and the Pruritus Numerical Rating
      Scale (NRS), which indicates the intensity of itching. Reductions of 91% in EASI 
      scores and 69% in Pruritus NRS scores showed that the improvement in signs and
      symptoms persisted for 204 weeks (almost 4 years) of treatment, and these effects
      were sustained following the switch from weekly treatment to the approved every
      other week treatment with dupilumab. The safety and efficacy data presented here 
      support the use of dupilumab as a continuous, long-term treatment for up to 4
      years for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

AB  - Where does the seed of recovery from trauma, from illness, from injury find
      ground, sink roots, and start to grow? Can one find empowerment in a body,
      subjected to illness, trauma and disability? In this autobiographical article,
      the authors takes us on a journey into illness, where despair threatens her very 
      will to live. In fact, she becomes to herself something foreign, grotesque, and
      completely other. And yet, hope sprouts. This work has two voices: the primary
      voice describes the power of dance in her healing from paralysis (hemiparesis and
      complete disfigurement of the face) due to viral encephalitis caused by herpes
      zoster (chickenpox). Sentenced not to walk again, she desperately and willfully
      turned to dancing to help in her recovery. It took her two years to return to
      formal dance classes and seven years to perform professionally again. In this
      article, she shares in an intimate conversation how dance can be more than an
      aesthetic art, and can support the process of transformational rehabilitation.
      The secondary voice from the co-author urges dance/movement therapists to listen 
      carefully to direct experience, and utilize an embodied inquiry into illness and 
      healing. Autobiographical experience offers an invitation for dance/movement
      therapists to further their understanding of the lived experience of
      rehabilitation and the psychology of illness and thereby deepen their capacity to
      clinically support the painful process of integration when healing does not look 
      like a return to a level of prior functioning.

TI  - A 1-Year Survey of Zoster-Associated Pain after Amenamevir Treatment.
PG  - 1239-1252

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amenamevir is a new anti-varicella-zoster virus drug that inhibits 
      the helicase-primase complex involved in viral replication. Amenamevir has the
      same effect as valaciclovir on acute pain and skin eruption, but no studies have 
      examined the presence of long-term zoster-associated pain (ZAP) or postherpetic
      neuralgia (PHN) after amenamevir treatment. METHODS: A total of 785 herpes zoster
      patients treated with amenamevir were followed up for 12 months. Patients
      recorded their pain status on a questionnaire once a month. RESULTS: The
      proportion of patients with pain was 20.8% at 90 days, 8.0% at 180 days, 3.8% at 
      270 days, and 2.7% at 360 days after treatment. The median residual pain duration
      was 48 days. ZAP resolution rate slowed between 90 and 120 days, suggesting that 
      the main feature of ZAP is a shift from nociceptive pain to neuropathic pain.
      Older age and more severe skin symptoms at the first visit were associated with a
      higher risk of developing PHN. Median ZAP duration was high for the head, face,
      and upper back and chest. Regarding the nature of pain, sudden pain attacks that 
      felt like electric shocks, sensation of numbness, burning sensation, and
      cold/heat pain tended to remain as PHN. CONCLUSIONS: Although conclusions must
      remain tentative without further comparative studies, amenamevir seems to have a 
      similar effect on PHN as conventional nucleoside analogs, despite having a
      different action mechanism. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000035938.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although the association between genetic factors, such as RNF213
      mutations, and moyamoya disease (MMD) has been well investigated, environmental
      factors are largely undetermined. Thus, we aimed to examine whether viral
      infection increases the risk of MMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To eliminate the
      effect of presence or absence of the RNF213 p.R4810K mutation, the entire study
      population was positive for this mutation. We collected whole blood from 111
      patients with MMD (45 familial and 66 sporadic cases) and 67 healthy volunteers, 
      and we measured the immunoglobulin G titer of 11 viruses (cytomegalovirus,
      varicella-zoster virus, measles virus, rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, mumps
      virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6 [HHV6],
      human herpesvirus 8, and John Cunningham virus) that were presumed to be
      associated with vasculopathy using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      Positivity for past viral infection was determined by cut-off values obtained
      from previous reports and the manufacturer's instructions, and the positive rate 
      was compared between cases and age- and sex-matched controls. We performed
      familial case-specific and sporadic case-specific analyses, as well as a
      case-control analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the
      positive rate between the case group and the control group in any of the
      analyses. A significant difference was only observed in the combined case-control
      analysis for HHV6 (p = 0.046), but the viral antibody-positive rate in control
      individuals was higher than in MMD cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our cross-sectional study 
      suggest that the investigated 11 viruses including HHV6 are unlikely to have an
      impact on MMD development.

TI  - Purpura fulminans, TEN, and disseminated herpes simplex: An unexpected
      combination.
PG  - e05784
LID - 10.1002/ccr3.5784 [doi]
AB  - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and purpura
      fulminans (PF) are all rare conditions. A combination of these 3 conditions
      together with a viral infection is very rare. A 52-year-old, previously healthy
      woman which developed SJS, potentially due to a reaction to CT contrast, although
      this is still unknown. This developed into TEN on day 10 of the initial
      admission, the patient scored 3 points on SCORTEN. On day 12 from initial
      admission, she developed unexpected multiorgan failure and PF. The patient passed
      away 2 days later, the autopsy demonstrates herpes simplex virus in the bladder
      and lungs on immunohistological staining. Our clinical case encountered the
      challenge of differentiating TEN and PF. The microscopic and immunochemical
      examination confirmed the clinical suspicion of PF but also a disseminated herpes
      simplex infection. We speculate the clinical route of this case started SJS and
      TEN, leading to superimposed infection with three different types of bacteria,
      confirmed in blood cultures, and a disseminated viral infection. The combination 
      of all these diagnoses are very rare, no similar case has been described in
      adults to the authors' knowledge. We recommend a prompt diagnosis and early
      recognition of both bacterial and viral infections to prevent the development of 
      PF.

AB  - Background: Acyclovir represents the first-line prophylaxis and therapy for
      herpes virus infections. However, its pharmacokinetics in children exposes them
      to the risk of ineffective or toxic concentrations. The study was aimed at
      investigating the population pharmacokinetics (POP/PK) of intravenous (IV)
      acyclovir in oncologic children. Methods: Patients (age, 8.6 +/- 5.0 years, 73
      males and 47 females) received IV acyclovir for prophylaxis (n = 94) and therapy 
      (n = 26) under a therapeutic drug monitoring (i.e., minimum and maximal plasma
      concentrations, >0.5 and <25 mg/L, respectively). Plasma concentrations were
      fitted by nonlinear mixed effect modeling and a simulation of dosing regimens was
      performed. Findings were stratified according to an estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) threshold of 250 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Results: The final
      1-compartment POP/PK model showed that eGFR had a significant effect on drug
      clearance, while allometric body weight influenced both clearance and volume of
      distribution. The population clearance (14.0 +/- 5.5 L/h) was consistent across
      occasions. Simulation of standard 1-h IV infusion showed that a 10-mg/kg dose
      every 6 h achieved target concentrations in children with normal eGFR (i.e.,
      </=250 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Increased eGFR values required higher doses that led to
      an augmented risk of toxic peak concentrations. On the contrary, simulated
      prolonged (i.e., 2 and 3-h) or continuous IV infusions at lower doses increased
      the probability of target attainment while reducing the risk of toxicities.
      Conclusion: Due to the variable pharmacokinetics of acyclovir, standard dosing
      regimens may not be effective in some patients. Prospective trials should confirm
      the therapeutic advantage of prolonged and continuous IV infusions.

PG  - 100378
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100378 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in women 
      worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the association between common urogenital
      infections and cervical neoplasia. Methods: A multi-register national cohort
      study of 4,120,557 women aged >/=15 years (2002-2018) was conducted. The outcomes
      were cervical cancer and carcinoma in situ (Swedish Cancer Register). The main
      predictors were urogenital infections-(urinary) cystitis, (bacterial) vaginosis, 
      (candida) vulvovaginitis. Incidence rates per 10,000 person-years were calculated
      (using the European Standard Population). Cox regression was used to estimate
      hazard ratios (HR) while adjusting for possible confounders-other genital
      infections (e.g., cervicitis, salpingitis, urogenital herpes), parity, and
      sociodemographic factors. Findings: In 39.0 million person-years of follow-up,
      the incidence rate for cervical cancer was 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.2) per 10,000
      person-years and the figure for cervical carcinoma in situ was more than tenfold 
      higher. The fully adjusted HRs for cervical cancer were 1.31 (95% CI 1.15 and
      1.48) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.16 and 1.29) for vaginosis and cystitis, respectively.
      Vaginosis showed a gradient association to carcinoma in situ. Vulvovaginitis was 
      inversely associated with cervical cancer, but not significantly related with
      carcinoma in situ in the fully adjusted model. A temporal association with
      cervical cancer was observed for vaginosis and vulvovaginitis (inversely) but not
      for cystitis. Interpretation: In this large nationwide cohort of women, medically
      attended common urogenital infections were independently associated with cervical
      neoplasia, but cystitis was not temporally associated with cervical neoplasia.
      These findings could be used to increase focus on preventive measures,
      HPV-vaccination programmes, HPV-analyses- and cervical cancer screening,
      especially in women suffering from vaginosis. Future studies on the causal
      mechanism are warranted before generalized public health recommendations can be
      made. Funding: Region Skane, Tore Nilsons Stiftelse, and Swedish Society of
      Medicine.

TI  - Real-world evidence of tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis patients in Spain.
PG  - 63-71
LID - 10.5582/ddt.2022.01028 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the real-world 
      data on the use of tofacitinib in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
      in Spain. Sixteen retrospective studies carried out in Spain between 2019 and
      2021 have been analyzed, considering patients' characteristics, and treatment
      patterns, effectiveness, and safety. In those studies, approximately 511 patients
      received tofacitinib during the study period. They were predominantly women (mean
      age: 48-61 years). The percentage of patients receiving tofacitinib as
      monotherapy ranged between 20.0% and 67.9%. Only five studies reported the
      combined use of corticosteroids (42.0-84.5% of patients), with a mean dose
      varying from 1.8 to 7.2 mg. A wide range of patients (36.0-85.7%) had failed a
      previous biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. The most frequent
      reason for treatment discontinuation was the lack of efficacy, and the most
      common adverse event described was herpes zoster infection. Real-world studies
      complement clinical trials by adding efficacy and safety data in real-world
      settings to the benefit/risk profile of the drug. The profile of RA patients
      receiving tofacitinib in Spain has similarities with other real-world studies
      conducted in other countries.

TI  - The C-Terminal Penta-Peptide Repeats of Major Royal Jelly Protein 3 Ameliorate
      the Progression of Inflammation in Vivo and in Vitro.
PG  - 583-589
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b21-00922 [doi]
AB  - Royal jelly (RJ) has been used as a functional foodstuff and in cosmetics for
      many years. RJ contains various molecules, including major royal jelly proteins
      (MRJPs), and affords a number of health benefits such as anti-inflammatory
      activity. As MRJP3 has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties by
      the in vitro analysis, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of MRJP3 and
      its derived peptides both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of both tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs in lipopolysaccharides
      (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells was reduced by the addition of MRJP3 or its
      C-terminal tandem penta-peptide repeats (TPRs) sequence. In the herpes simplex
      virus type 1 (HSV-1)-induced herpes stromal keratitis (HSK) model mice, the
      instillation of TPRs reduced the disease scores and the expression levels of
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 in HSV-1-infected eyes. In addition, synthetic penta-peptides 
      derived from TPRs reduced the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 both in the THP-1 
      cell cultures and in the HSK model mice. Our results indicated that MRJP3 TPRs
      would be useful in controlling inflammation.

TI  - An integrated analysis of herpes virus infections from eight randomized clinical 
      studies of baricitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with an increased risk for viral
      infections including those caused by herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster
      virus. OBJECTIVES: This study examined treatment-emergent (TE) herpes simplex
      infection including eczema herpeticum (EH), and herpes zoster (HZ), in adult
      patients with AD receiving >/=1 dose of baricitinib (BARI), an oral selective
      inhibitor of Janus kinase 1/2. METHODS: We evaluated data from six
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled (PC) trials and two long-term
      extension studies, within three analysis sets: PC, 2-4-mg BARI extended and
      All-BARI-AD. Frequency, incidence rate (IR)/100 person-years (PYs) and clinical
      characteristics of TE-herpes simplex, EH and HZ were reported. RESULTS: In the
      All-BARI-AD dataset (n = 2531; 2247 PYs), herpes simplex was reported in 8.9% of 
      patients (n = 224; IR = 10.3). Most herpes simplex events were rated as mild or
      moderate (93.3%), rarely led to permanent discontinuation (2.2%) and presented
      mostly as oral/perioral herpes simplex (51.3%). TE-EH occurred at a low frequency
      (All-BARI-AD 1.7% n = 43; IR = 2.0) and were reported in 0.5%, 0.2% and 1.4% of
      patients receiving placebo, 2-mg or 4-mg BARI respectively. In the All-BARI-AD
      dataset, most events were investigator-rated as mild/moderate (79.1%), affected
      </=2% of the body surface area (74.2%) and occurred as single events (88.4%).
      Serious TE-EH (n = 11) occurred exclusively in patients with poor disease control
      (vIGA-AD score >/=3) at infection onset. TE-HZ was reported in 2.1% of BARI
      patients (n = 53; IR = 2.3), without a dose relationship during the PC period (IR
      = 2.7 and IR = 0.0) or the extended dataset (IR = 3.7 and IR = 1.7) for 2- or
      4-mg BARI respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TE-herpes simplex was common, while
      occurrence of EH was uncommon. Most events of EH were localized with involvement 
      of a small BSA and were linked to poor disease control. Events of HZ were rare in
      the PC dataset and without a dose dependent increase in frequency.

TI  - Time to Onset of Bendamustine-associated Skin Damage Using the Spontaneous
      Reporting System.
PG  - 2737-2741
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.15752 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Bendamustine-associated skin damage occurs frequently in Japan
      and can have a profound impact on health-related quality of life. To our
      knowledge, there are no reports on the timing of skin damage caused by
      bendamustine. This study assessed trends in and the time to onset of skin damage 
      caused by bendamustine using the Japanese Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting
      Database (JADER). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data related to skin damage with more
      than five reported cases from April 2004 to March 2021 were extracted from JADER,
      and the relative risk of adverse events was estimated using the reporting odds
      ratio and 95% confidence interval. The data were analyzed for time to onset of
      skin damage. RESULTS: JADER included a total of 2,450 reports of adverse drug
      reactions from bendamustine. Of these, 170 skin ailments of 10 types were
      reported to be associated with bendamustine. Significant associations for skin
      damage were found for rash, herpes zoster, and infusion-related reactions. The
      reporting odds ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for rash, herpes zoster, and
      infusion-related reaction were 1.63 (1.19-2.21), 3.25 (2.20-4.78), and 7.25
      (4.84-10.85), respectively. The median onset (interquartile range) of rash,
      herpes zoster, and infusion-related reactions caused by bendamustine were 13
      (10-28), 60 (28-107), and 6 (1-28) days, respectively. CONCLUSION: A
      comprehensive study using a pharmacovigilance approach enabled us to identify
      that a rash or infusion-related reaction may be expected within 2 weeks of
      treatment with bendamustine and that the onset of herpes zoster occurs at a
      median of 2 months after treatment with bendamustine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      characteristics of patients with varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation
      involving the cranial nerves and central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: This is a
      retrospective, multi-center case-series of 37 patients with VZV infection
      affecting the cranial nerves and CNS. RESULTS: The median age was 71 years [IQR
      51.5-76]; 21 (57%) were men. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was available in 24/37
      (65%); median CSF white blood cell count was 11 [IQR 2-23] cells/muL and protein 
      was 45.5 [IQR 34.5-75.5] mg/dL. VZV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were
      positive in 6/21 (29%) CSF and 8/9 (89%) ocular samples. Clinical involvement
      included the optic nerve in 12 (32%), other cranial nerves in 20 (54%), brain
      parenchyma in 12 (32%) and spinal cord or nerve roots in 4 (11%). Twenty-seven/28
      immunocompetent patients' MRIs were available for review (96%). Of the 27, 18 had
      T1 postcontrast fat saturated sequences without motion artifact to evaluate for
      cranial nerve enhancement and optic perineuritis (OPN). Eight/18 (44%)
      demonstrated OPN. All 8 experienced vision loss: 3 optic neuritis, 1 acute
      retinal necrosis, and 3 CNS vasculitis with 1 central and 1 branch retinal artery
      occlusion and 1 uveitis. Diplopic patients had cranial nerve and cavernous sinus 
      enhancement. All immunosuppressed patients were imaged. Seven/9 (88%) had
      extensive neuraxis involvement, including encephalitis, vasculitis and transverse
      myelitis; one case had OPN. CONCLUSION: OPN is a frequent manifestation in
      VZV-associated vision loss among immunocompetent patients. Immunosuppressed
      patients had greater neuraxis involvement. Optimizing MRI protocols may improve
      early diagnosis in VZV reactivation.

      disease.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.27818 [doi]
AB  - Adenoids and tonsils have gained interest as a new in vivo model to study local
      immune functions and virus reservoirs. Especially herpesviruses are interesting
      because their prevalence and persistence in local lymphoid tissue are
      incompletely known. Our aim was to study herpesvirus and common respiratory virus
      infections in nonacutely ill adenotonsillar surgery patients. Adenoid and/or
      palatine tonsil tissue and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected
      from elective adenoidectomy (n = 45) and adenotonsillectomy (n = 44) patients
      (median age: 5, range: 1-20). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to
      detect 22 distinct viruses from collected samples. The overall prevalence of
      herpesviruses was 89% and respiratory viruses 94%. Human herpesviruses 6 (HHV6), 
      7 (HHV7), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were found, respectively, in adenoids
      (33%, 26%, 25%), tonsils (45%, 52%, 23%), and NPA (46%, 38%, 25%). Copy numbers
      of the HHV6 and HHV7 genome were significantly higher in tonsils than in
      adenoids. Patients with intra-adenoid HHV6 were younger than those without.
      Detection rates of EBV and HHV7 showed agreement between corresponding sample
      types. This study shows that adenoid and tonsil tissues commonly harbor human
      herpes- and respiratory viruses, and it shows the differences in virus findings
      between sample types.

AB  - Herpes simplex keratitis is an important infectious cause of blindness worldwide.
      The mainstay of antiviral therapy is treatment with long-established nucleoside
      analogues orally or topically. However, the emergence of resistant strains may
      become a major health concern in the future. Therefore, the development of backup
      antiherpetic medicines is urgently needed. Small molecule PDSTP is known to be
      active against herpes simplex type 1 strains in vitro, affecting early
      host-pathogen interactions. Here, we evaluated its preclinical efficacy in a
      rabbit model of herpes simplex epithelial keratitis. The mean course of keratitis
      and the corneal lesions in the 1.0% PDSTP gel group was statistically
      significantly less than in the negative control group and was comparable to that 
      in the aciclovir group. These findings open up new opportunities for the
      development of antiherpetic drugs with an original mechanism of action.

AB  - Malignant brain tumors constitute nearly one-third of cancer diagnoses in
      children and have recently surpassed hematologic malignancies as the most lethal 
      neoplasm in the pediatric population. Outcomes for children with brain tumors are
      unacceptably poor and current standards of care-surgical resection, chemotherapy,
      and radiation-are associated with significant long-term morbidity. Oncolytic
      virotherapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of brain
      tumors. While the majority of brain tumor clinical trials utilizing oncolytic
      virotherapy have been in adults, five viruses are being tested in pediatric brain
      tumor clinical trials: herpes simplex virus (G207), reovirus
      (pelareorep/Reolysin), measles virus (MV-NIS), poliovirus (PVSRIPO), and
      adenovirus (DNX-2401, AloCELYVIR). Herein, we review past and current pediatric
      immunovirotherapy brain tumor trials including the relevant preclinical and
      clinical research that contributed to their development. We describe mechanisms
      by which the viruses may overcome barriers in treating pediatric brain tumors,
      examine challenges associated with achieving effective, durable responses,
      highlight unique aspects and successes of the trials, and discuss future
      directions of immunovirotherapy research for the treatment of pediatric brain
      tumors.

TI  - Monocyte Signature Associated with Herpes Simplex Virus Reactivation and
      Neurological Recovery after Brain Injury.
PG  - 295-310

AB  - Rationale: Brain injury induces systemic immunosuppression, increasing the risk
      of viral reactivations and altering neurological recovery. Objectives: To
      determine if systemic immune alterations and lung replication of herpesviridae
      are associated and can help predict outcomes after brain injury. Methods: We
      collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with severe brain injury
      requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. We systematically searched for
      respiratory herpes simplex virus (HSV) replications in tracheal aspirates. We
      also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and in
      vitro functional assays of monocytes and CD4 T cells collected on Day 1 to
      characterize the immune response to severe acute brain injury. The primary
      outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at 6 months. Measurements and Main
      Results: In 344 patients with severe brain injury, lung HSV reactivations were
      observed in 39% of the 232 patients seropositive for HSV and independently
      associated with poor neurological recovery at 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.08-3.57). Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of
      the transcriptomic response of monocytes to brain injury defined a module of 721 
      genes, including PD-L1 and CD80, enriched for the binding DNA motif of the
      transcriptional factor Zeb2 and whose ontogenic analyses revealed decreased
      IFN-gamma-mediated and antiviral response signaling pathways. This monocyte
      signature was preserved in a validation cohort and predicted the neurological
      outcome at 6 months with good accuracy (area under the curve, 0.786; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.593-0.978). Conclusions: A specific monocyte signature is 
      associated with HSV reactivation and predicts poor recovery after brain injury.
      The alterations of the immune control of herpesviridae replication are
      understudied and represent a novel therapeutic target.

AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis is a devastating neurological disorder with a poor
      prognosis. For years, it remained elusive why a fraction of otherwise healthy
      individuals presented with the condition; this lack of insight has hampered
      understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of novel effective
      therapies. However, recent studies have shown that the lack of viral containment 
      can be caused by functionally related monogenic inborn errors of immunity at
      least in a subset of patients. This knowledge renders prophylactic measures and
      design of targeted therapies possible, as argued in this review.

TI  - The Impact of Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents on Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in
      Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.
PG  - 1365-1372
LID - 90075 [pii]
LID - 10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.4.1365 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The co-infection of HCV/CMV may accelerate the progression of liver
      diseases and worsen responsiveness to IFN treatment. The Direct-acting antiviral 
      agents (DAAs), currently approved therapy for HCV, may cause a transient change
      in immune status, favoring the reactivation of other viruses. The current study
      aims to evaluate the impact of DAAs treatment on the reactivation of latent CMV
      in HCV patients. METHODS: The serological IgG, IgM Abs against CMV were detected 
      by ELISA on192 HCV patients. The seronegative CMV IgM patients received
      (sofosbuvir/daclatasvir) regimen, then the CMV reactivation was examined by
      measuring the CMV IgM by ELISA and CMV DNA by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The
      serological data revealed that all patients were positive for CMV IgG (100%)
      while (64%) patients were positive for CMV IgM. The seronegative CMV IgM (36%)
      received the DAAs protocol. The sustained virological response was monitored by
      measuring the HCV RNA viremia in the patient sera. The serological data revealed 
      that 28.6% of patients had a reactivation of CMV, while 18.5% of patients had
      detectable CMV DNA viremia. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in
      liver function as well as a decrease in FIB-4 and APRI scores at EOT. SVR was
      reached 97.4% among the total studied patients (N= 192). CONCLUSION: CMV
      co-infection has no impact on the response rate to DAAs. However, the CMV
      reactivation might have occurred after the complete eradication of HCV by DAAs.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids in
      patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with inadequate response,
      intolerance or contraindication to ciclosporin: results from a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial (BREEZE-AD4).
LID - 10.1111/bjd.21630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK 2
      inhibitor, was shown to improve the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe
      atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      baricitinib with background topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients with
      moderate-to-severe AD and inadequate response, intolerance or contraindication to
      ciclosporin A (CA). METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, phase III study, patients were randomized 1: 1: 2: 1 to
      placebo (N = 93), baricitinib 1 mg (N = 93), 2 mg (N = 185) or 4 mg (N = 92) with
      background TCS. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving
      baricitinib 4 mg or 2 mg (+ TCS) vs. placebo + TCS who achieved >/= 75%
      improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at week
      16. RESULTS: Baricitinib 4 mg + TCS was superior to placebo + TCS for EASI 75 (4 
      mg: 32%, placebo: 17%, P = 0.031) at week 16 and for improvements in itch, skin
      pain and number of night-time awakenings owing to itch. Improvements were
      maintained through 52 weeks of treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events
      (TEAEs) were more common with baricitinib than placebo (+ TCS); most were mild or
      moderate. The most frequent TEAEs with baricitinib 4 mg + TCS were
      nasopharyngitis, herpes simplex, influenza and headache. No deaths or deep vein
      thromboses were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib 4 mg + TCS improved the signs 
      and symptoms of moderate-to-severe AD through 52 weeks of treatment in patients
      with inadequate response, intolerance or contraindication to CA. The safety
      profile was consistent with previous studies of baricitinib in moderate-to-severe
      AD. What is already known about this topic? Ciclosporin A is indicated for the
      treatment of atopic dermatitis that is refractory to topical therapies. However, 
      its use is limited by safety concerns and it may not provide adequate response
      for some patients. Baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2
      inhibitor, has been shown to improve the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe
      atopic dermatitis as a monotherapy or in combination with topical
      corticosteroids. What does this study add? Baricitinib combined with background
      low- or moderate-potency topical corticosteroids provided improvements in the
      signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis through 1 year of
      treatment in patients with a contraindication, intolerance or failure to respond 
      to ciclosporin A. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with
      baricitinib 4 mg were nasopharyngitis, herpes simplex, influenza and headache.
      The safety profile was consistent with previous studies in patients with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

AB  - People who are homeless experience higher rates of vaccine-preventable disease,
      including COVID-19, than the general population, and poorer associated health
      outcomes. However, delivering vaccinations to people who are homeless is complex,
      and there is a lack of evidence to inform practice in this area. The aim of this 
      systematic review is to: (a) identify, (b) analyse the characteristics of, and
      (c) evaluate the outcomes of, strategies to improve vaccination rates in people
      who are homeless. Literature was retrieved from eight electronic databases.
      Studies undertaken in high-income countries, published in English, in a
      peer-reviewed journal, and in full-text were considered. No limits were placed on
      study design or date. A total of 1,508 articles were retrieved and, after the
      removal of duplicates, 637 were screened. Twenty-three articles, reporting on
      nineteen separate vaccination strategies for hepatitis A/B, influenza, herpes
      zoster, invasive pneumococcal disease, and diphtheria in people who are homeless,
      were selected for inclusion. All the strategies were effective at improving
      vaccination rates in, people who are homeless. Most strategies involved
      vaccination clinics and most were delivered, at least in part, by nurses. Other
      characteristics of successful strategies included: delivering vaccinations at
      convenient locations; using accelerated vaccination schedules (if available);
      vaccinating at the first appointment, regardless of whether a person's
      vaccination history or serological status were known (if clinically safe);
      operating for a longer duration; offering training to staff about working with
      people who are homeless; widely promoting clinics; considering education,
      reminders, incentives, and co-interventions; ensuring no out-of-pocket costs; and
      working collaboratively with stakeholders, including people who are homeless
      themselves. These findings will inform evidence-based vaccination strategies,
      including for COVID-19, in people who are homeless, and improve associated health
      outcomes in this at-risk, hard-to-reach group.

AB  - Physicians routinely treat sick children in the emergency department (ED). Many
      relevant articles on pediatric medicine are published in journals that are not
      typically read by many general emergency medicine physicians. We reviewed salient
      pediatric emergency medicine literature from the past year and identified ten
      impactful articles for general emergency physicians. This review includes studies
      of pediatric pneumonia, brief resolved unexplained events, covid-19, hemorrhage
      control, retropharyngeal abscess, infant fever, diabetic ketoacidosis, mastitis, 
      buckle fractures, and invasive herpes simplex virus infection.

TI  - Association of Photodynamic Therapy and Photobiomodulation As a Promising
      Treatment of Herpes Labialis: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 299-307
LID - 10.1089/photob.2021.0186 [doi]
AB  - Background: This systematic review aims to analyze the effectiveness of the
      association of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photobiomodulation (PBM) in the
      treatment of recurrent herpes labialis and to analyze the very many variables of 
      parameters applied, number of sessions, photosensitizer concentration, and the
      timing of the intervention to offer clinicians an indication of the most likely
      optimal techniques and parameters required to achieve clinical success. Methods: 
      This study was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA Checklist and registered at the
      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). We searched 
      and identified articles of the subsequent bibliographic databases: PubMed and
      Cochrane. Results: Since there are no clinical trials regarding the association
      of PDT and PBM in the treatment of herpes labialis, we only included case reports
      in our review. All studies used methylene blue solution as the photosensitizer
      and the laser (diode laser or low-power laser) with a wavelength of 660 nm as the
      light source. Power output, power density, number of irradiation points, number
      of PBM sessions, and irradiation duration varied between the included studies.
      Despite the diversity in parameters between studies, all case reports showed good
      results regarding relieving symptoms, accelerating healing, as well as reducing
      the incidence of recurrence without side effects. Conclusions: The association of
      PDT in the vesicular phase and PBM in the crust phase can be considered a
      promising solution for recurrent labial herpes. Despite the many successful cases
      reported, establishing an effective clinical protocol for the treatment of herpes
      labialis using PDT followed by PBM will only be possible through double-blind
      placebo studies that would elucidate the exact action of this treatment modality,
      the appropriate irradiation parameters for both therapies, optimal timing, and
      number of PBM sessions following PDT. This review has been registered at the
      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under number 
      CRD42021290757.

PG  - 757-765
LID - 10.12669/pjms.38.3.5140 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The objective was to provide synthesized evidence on the efficacy of
      local anaesthetics and steroid injections for prevention and management of PHN,
      compared to the standard treatment using anti-viral and analgesic medications.
      The primary outcomes of interest were incidence of PHN and duration of neuralgic 
      pain. Methods: Comprehensive searches were done systematically through PubMed,
      Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google scholar
      databases. Randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of local
      anaesthetics and steroid injections for preventing and managing PHN were included
      for this meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was done for papers published
      until 15(th) July 2021. Results: A total of 10 RCTs were included in the
      meta-analysis. In the overall pooled analyses, compared to standard care/placebo,
      those receiving a combination of local anaesthetic and steroid injection had 55% 
      lower risk of PHN at 3 months from onset of rash (RR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29; 0.70).
      Out of the different modes of intervention delivery i.e., intravenous,
      subcutaneous and nerve block, maximum beneficial effect in reducing the incidence
      of PHN was noted in nerve block (RR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.89). Conclusions: The
      meta-analysis provides some evidence to support the use of combined local
      anaesthetic and steroids in reducing risk of post-herpetic neuralgia and duration
      of neuralgic pain in patients with herpes zoster rash.

AB  - Atypical morphologic and anatomic presentations of herpetic infection can be a
      diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Although herpes simplex virus type 2
      (HSV-2) infections primarily occur in the oral or anogenital region, our patient 
      presented with ulcerated vegetative plaques on the shoulder sharing clinical
      features with nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Depending on the clinical
      appearance and anatomical site, proper workup including biopsy can be pivotal to 
      arrive at a correct diagnosis as lesions can mimic a broad spectrum of cutaneous 
      diseases, particularly if the lesion occurs in an atypical location. Dermatology 
      providers should include HSV-2 in the differential diagnosis when challenged with
      unusual ulcerated or verrucous lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common skin disease resulting from a
      regionally limited reactivation of a latent infection with the varicella zoster
      virus (VZV). Despite its usually self-limiting course, HZ is associated with a
      considerable individual and public health burden of disease, particularly due to 
      its high rate of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). OBJECTIVES: To improve knowledge
      of the current recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Narrative review and summary of current guideline
      recommendations. RESULTS: In Germany, the recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine 
      is recommended for all adults of 60+ years and for immunocompromised persons of
      50+ years. The diagnosis of HZ is clinical; in case of uncertainty, laboratory
      investigations can help confirm the diagnosis. For patients with HZ ophthalmicus,
      HZ oticus or neurological complications, an interdisciplinary approach is
      advantageous. Antiviral treatment should be started as early as possible; various
      factors, including the duration and location of the disease, the patient's age
      and signs of a complicated course, serve to determine the indication to initiate 
      an antiviral medication. The choice of the appropriate treatment depends, among
      other factors, on the intravenous availability, comorbidities and intake
      preferences. Early and sufficient analgesic treatment according to the WHO pain
      ladder and, if required, with anticonvulsant adjuvants is necessary to treat
      acute pain and to reduce the risk for PHN. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the
      current recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HZ and PHN
      is important to reduce the high burden of disease and improve quality of life of 
      the patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease induced by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that frequently presents with
      skin manifestations. The five most common skin lesions are pseudo-chilblain and
      maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, and livedo/necrotizing skin lesions. These 
      skin lesions are of diagnostic and prognostic relevance. For example, in
      children, typical skin lesions may indicate a life-threatening inflammatory
      syndrome, which rarely occurs after corona infection. Skin lesions have also been
      described after COVID-19 vaccination. These usually show an uncomplicated,
      self-limiting course and therefore do not represent a contraindication for
      completing the vaccination status in the vast majority of cases.

      virotherapy in hypoxia.
PG  - 164
LID - 10.1186/s12935-022-02564-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel strategies are required since the hypoxic tumor
      microenvironment is one of the important impediments for conventional cancer
      therapy. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein can block aerobic respiration 
      in cancer cells. We hypothesized that HMGB1could also kill the colorectal cancer 
      cells during hypoxia. METHODS: In this study, we developed oncolytic herpes
      simplex virus type 1 expressing HMGB1 protein (HSV-HMGB1) and investigated the
      cytotoxic effect of HSV-HMGB1 and its parental virus (HSV-ble) on three
      colorectal cancer cells (HCT116, SW480, and HT29) under normoxic (20% oxygen) and
      hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. We further identified potential autophagy-
      related genes in HT29 cells by retrieving mRNA expression microarray datasets
      from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. These genes were then detected in HT29
      cells infected with HSV-HMGB1 and HSV-ble during normoxia and hypoxia by
      Real-Time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The cytotoxic effect of HSV-HMGB1 
      was significantly higher than that of HSV-ble during normoxia; however, during
      hypoxia, HSV-HMGB1 enhanced the viability of HT29 cells at MOI 0.1. Analyzing the
      cell death pathway revealed that HSV-HMGB1 induced autophagy in HT29 cells under 
      hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it appears that oncolytic
      virotherapy is cell context-dependent. Therefore, understanding the cancer cells'
      characteristics, microenvironment, and cell signaling are essential to improve
      the therapeutic strategies.

      Allergy: A Case of Herpes Encephalitis].
PG  - 371-376
LID - 10.5578/mb.20229816 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a sporadic viral encephalitis agent that causes
      high mortality and morbidity, accompanied by neurological dysfunction findings.
      Acyclovir is the only antiviral treatment option that should be initiated in all 
      patients with suspected encephalitis as soon as possible. Acyclovir is rarely
      possible to cause allergic reactions. It may occur in a wide range from
      generalized cutaneous rash to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. A case of HSV-1
      encephalitis who had no treatment option other than intravenous acyclovir and was
      successfully treated with intravenous desensitization was presented in this
      report. A 59-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with 
      complaints of high fever and altered consciousness. Diagnostic lumbar puncture
      was performed and intravenous acyclovir treatment was initiated empirically with 
      the preliminary diagnosis of encephalitis. On the third day of the treatment, HSV
      type 1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was detected as positive. Acyclovir
      treatment was discontinued due to the development of a severe allergic reaction
      on the fifth day of acyclovir treatment. Allergic symptoms of the patient
      regressed with discontinuation of acyclovir treatment and application of
      concomitant methylprednisolone treatment. The intravenous acyclovir
      desensitization protocol was applied to the patient, and the patient was
      successfully treated. In this case, it has been shown that intravenous acyclovir 
      desensitization can be applied in the treatment of life-threatening infections
      with no treatment options other than intravenous acyclovir. Our case is the first
      adult case in the literature to be treated with intravenous acyclovir
      desensitization.

LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2060668 [doi]
AB  - The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends recombinant
      zoster vaccine (RZV) to prevent against herpes zoster (HZ) and related
      complications in immunocompetent adults >/=50 y and immunocompromised adults
      >/=19 y. In 2019, a statistical safety signal for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)
      following RZV was identified using data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).
      Subsequently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and collaborators undertook additional
      analyses using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare data to
      further investigate the potential risk of GBS following RZV. Concurrently,
      epidemiologic data suggested a potentially elevated risk of GBS following HZ in
      U.S. adults. Using data from these sources and a published simulation model, this
      study evaluated the health benefits and risks associated with vaccinating
      immunocompetent adults >/=50 y with RZV compared to no vaccination. In the base
      case analysis, RZV vaccination averted 43,000-63,000 cases of HZ, including GBS
      complications, per million vaccinated per 10-y age cohort compared to 3-6
      additional cases of GBS projected following RZV per million vaccinated in the
      same population. This analysis highlights the projected health benefits of RZV
      vaccination compared to the relatively low potential risk of GBS following RZV.

      Keratitis: A Preliminary Study.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.4.21 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Herpes epithelial keratitis (HEK) is the most common form of herpes
      simplex virus (HSV) eye involvement, and understanding the molecular mechanisms
      underlying HEK is important. We investigated the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs)
      in the tears of patients with HEK. Methods: Tear samples from eight patients with
      HEK and seven age-matched controls were evaluated. Clinical ophthalmologic
      evaluation was performed, and an anterior segment photograph was obtained after
      fluorescence staining. Dendritic or geographic ulcer areas were measured using
      ImageJ software. The expression of 43 different miRNAs in tears was measured
      using real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared between patients with HEK 
      and controls. Differences in miRNA expression between the dendritic and
      geographic ulcer groups and correlations involving miRNA expression and ulcer
      area were evaluated. Results: Of the 43 miRNAs, 23 were upregulated in patients
      with HEK compared to normal controls. MiR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-20b-5p,
      miR-21-5p, miR-23b-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30d-5p, miR-92a-3p,
      miR-124-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-132-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-146a-5p,
      miR-146b-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-223-3p, and
      miR-338-5p were significantly upregulated in patients with HEK. MiR-29a-3p
      exhibited significant differences between the dendritic and geographic ulcer
      groups. All 23 miRNAs with significant differences between patients with HEK and 
      the control group were not significantly correlated with ulcer area. Conclusions:
      Twenty-three miRNAs were significantly upregulated in the tears of patients with 
      HEK, and the expression of miRNAs may play important roles in herpes infection in
      relation to host immunity.

      determined the interactome of capsid-host protein complexes of herpes simplex
      virus and identified the large dynamin-like GTPase myxovirus resistance protein B
      (MxB) as an interferon-inducible protein interacting with capsids. Electron
      microscopy analyses showed that cytosols containing MxB had the remarkable
      capability to disassemble the icosahedral capsids of herpes simplex viruses and
      varicella zoster virus into flat sheets of connected triangular faces. In
      contrast, capsids remained intact in cytosols with MxB mutants unable to
      hydrolyse GTP or to dimerize. Our data suggest that MxB senses herpesviral
      capsids, mediates their disassembly, and thereby restricts the efficiency of
      nuclear targeting of incoming capsids and/or the assembly of progeny capsids. The
      resulting premature release of viral genomes from capsids may enhance the
      activation of DNA sensors, and thereby amplify the innate immune responses.

TI  - Role of the Orphan Transporter SLC35E1 in the Nuclear Egress of Herpes Simplex
      Virus 1.
PG  - e0030622
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00306-22 [doi]
AB  - This study developed a system consisting of two rounds of screening cellular
      proteins involved in the nuclear egress of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Using 
      this system, we first screened cellular proteins that interacted with the HSV-1
      nuclear egress complex (NEC) consisting of UL34 and UL31 in HSV-1-infected cells,
      which are critical for the nuclear egress of HSV-1, by tandem affinity
      purification coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology. Next, we
      performed CRISPR/Cas9-based screening of live HSV-1-infected reporter cells under
      fluorescence microscopy using single guide RNAs targeting the cellular proteins
      identified in the first proteomic screening to detect the mislocalization of the 
      lamin-associated protein emerin, which is a phenotype for defects in HSV-1
      nuclear egress. This study focused on a cellular orphan transporter SLC35E1, one 
      of the cellular proteins identified by the screening system. Knockout of SLC35E1 
      reduced HSV-1 replication and induced membranous invaginations containing
      perinuclear enveloped virions (PEVs) adjacent to the nuclear membrane (NM),
      aberrant accumulation of PEVs in the perinuclear space between the inner and
      outer NMs and the invagination structures, and mislocalization of the NEC. These 
      effects were similar to those of previously reported mutation(s) in HSV-1
      proteins and depletion of cellular proteins that are important for HSV-1
      de-envelopment, one of the steps required for HSV-1 nuclear egress. Our newly
      established screening system enabled us to identify a novel cellular protein
      required for efficient HSV-1 de-envelopment. IMPORTANCE The identification of
      cellular protein(s) that interact with viral effector proteins and function in
      important viral procedures is necessary for enhancing our understanding of the
      mechanics of various viral processes. In this study, we established a new system 
      consisting of interactome screening for the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)
      nuclear egress complex (NEC), followed by loss-of-function screening to target
      the identified putative NEC-interacting cellular proteins to detect a defect in
      HSV-1 nuclear egress. This newly established system identified SLC35E1, an orphan
      transporter, as a novel cellular protein required for efficient HSV-1
      de-envelopment, providing an insight into the mechanisms involved in this viral
      procedure.

PG  - 101549
LID - 10.1016/j.ajoc.2022.101549 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Herpes zoster (HZ) has been identified as a potential association with
      the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. This study evaluated this possible association
      in a cohort of patients receiving the vaccination. Methods: Epic electronic
      health records of adult patients who received at least one COVID-19 vaccination
      between January 12, 2020 and 9/30/2021 within the NYU Langone Health were
      reviewed to analyze a new diagnosis of herpes zoster within 3 months before
      compared to 3 months after vaccination. Results: Of the 596,111 patients who
      received at least one COVID-19 vaccination, 716 patients were diagnosed with HZ
      within three months prior to vaccination, compared to 781 patients diagnosed
      within 3 months afterwards. Using the chi-square test for independence of
      proportions, there was not a statistically significant difference in frequency of
      HZ before (proportion: 0.0012, 95% CI: [0.0011, 0.0013]) vs. after vaccination
      (proportion: 0.0013, 95% CI: [0.0012, 0.0014]); (p = 0.093). Conclusions and
      importance: This study did not find evidence of an association between COVID-19
      vaccination and a new diagnosis of HZ. We encourage health care professionals to 
      strongly recommend COVID-19 vaccinations per Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      recommendations and vaccination against HZ according to Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approval for the recombinant zoster vaccine.

TI  - [A 73-year-old man with polyradiculopathy and multiple cranial neuropathies
      emerging separate from the originating dermatome of a varicella zoster skin
      lesion].
PG  - 380-385
LID - 10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001699 [doi]
AB  - A 73-year-old man developed delayed-onset multiple cranial neuropathies of
      cranial nerves V, VII and VIII, and segmental paresis in the ipsilateral upper
      extremity related to the C4 to Th1 segment, after all skin lesions with varicella
      zoster (VZV) on the left neck of the C3-4 dermatome had dried and crusted over.
      On admission, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (all mononuclear
      cells, 12/mul). Treatment was started with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, every
      8 h for 14 days) and methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day for 3 days). Four days
      after starting treatment, left segmental paresis was improved, but the multiple
      cranial neuropathies persisted. Oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) was
      administered for 5 days, then tapered off. All neurological symptoms had
      disappeared by hospital day 23. Of particular interest was the discrepancy
      between skin regions affected by VZV (C3-4) and the regions of cranial neuropathy
      (cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII) and muscle weakness innervated by C4-Th1.
      Although CSF was negative for VZV DNA according to PCR testing, the antibody
      index for VZV was elevated. This suggests intrathecal synthesis of VZV antibodies
      and supports the diagnosis of VZV meningitis. Also, all cranial nerves involved
      in this case were reported to have the cranial nerve ganglia where VZV could have
      established latency and been reactivated. This suggests concurrent reactivation
      on each cranial nerve ganglia without cutaneous lesions, as zoster sine herpete. 
      In addition, anastomoses among the upper cervical nerves, which are found in some
      patients, may have contributed to this condition. These mechanisms underlie
      various neurological symptoms associated with VZV infection.

TI  - Real-world evidence from over one million COVID-19 vaccinations is consistent
      with reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus.
PG  - 1342-1348
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes herpes
      zoster (HZ, synonym: shingles) in humans, can be a rare adverse reaction to
      vaccines. Recently, reports of cases after COVID-19 vaccination have arisen.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess whether the frequency of HZ is
      found to increase after COVID-19 vaccination in a large cohort, based on
      real-world data. As a hypothesis, the incidence of HZ was assumed to be
      significantly higher in subjects who received a COVID-19 vaccine (Cohort I) vs.
      unvaccinated individuals (Cohort II). METHODS: The initial cohorts of 1 095 086
      vaccinated and 16 966 018 unvaccinated patients were retrieved from the TriNetX
      database and were matched on age and gender in order to mitigate confounder bias.
      RESULTS: After matching, each cohort accounted for 1 095 086 patients. For the
      vaccinated group (Cohort I), 2204 subjects developed HZ within 60 days of
      COVID-19 vaccination, while among Cohort II, 1223 patients were diagnosed with HZ
      within 60 days after having visited the clinic for any other reason (i.e. not
      vaccination). The risk of developing shingles was calculated as 0.20% and 0.11%
      for cohort I and cohort II, respectively. The difference was statistically highly
      significant (P < 0.0001; log-rank test). The risk ratio and odds ratio were 1.802
      (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.680; 1.932) and 1.804 (95% CI = 1.682; 1.934). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the hypothesis, a higher incidence of HZ was
      statistically detectable post-COVID-19 vaccine. Accordingly, the eruption of HZ
      may be a rare adverse drug reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. Even though the
      molecular basis of VZV reactivation remains murky, temporary compromising of
      VZV-specific T-cell-mediated immunity may play a mechanistic role in
      post-vaccination pathogenesis of HZ. Note that VZV reactivation is a
      well-established phenomenon both with infections and with other vaccines (i.e.
      this adverse event is not COVID-19-specific).

AB  - Tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor approved in South
      Korea for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) on May 1,
      2019. However, safety data are lacking. We investigated the incidence of serious 
      adverse events (SAEs) in patients with UC using tofacitinib from the National
      Health Insurance Service database. In all, 1,026 UC patients were enrolled in
      this study. The overall incidences (100 person-years; 95% confidence interval) of
      SAEs were 4.06 (1.63-8.36) and 6.30 (4.59-8.43) in the tofacitinib and anti-TNFi 
      groups, respectively. No thromboembolic event occurred and major cardiovascular
      events occurred in only three patients (two unstable angina and one congestive
      heart failure) in the tofacitinib group. The incidence of herpes zoster and
      tuberculosis did not differ between the two groups. There was no difference in
      the overall incidence of SAEs, including thromboembolic events, between
      tofacitinib- and TNFi-treated UC patients.

AB  - Dioscin (Dio), steroid saponin, exists in several medicinal herbs with potent
      anticancer efficacy. This study aimed to explore the effect of Dio on the
      immune-related modulation and synergistic therapeutic effects of the herpes
      simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-Tk/GCV) suicide gene therapy
      system in murine melanoma, thereby providing a research basis to improve the
      potential immunomodulatory mechanism underlying combination therapy. Using both
      in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed the immunocidal effect of
      Dio-potentiated suicide gene therapy on melanoma. The results showed that Dio
      upregulated connexin 43 (Cx43) expression and improved gap junction intercellular
      communication (GJIC) in B16 cells while increasing the cross-presentation of
      antigens by dendritic cells (DCs), eventually promoting the activation and
      antitumor immune killing effects of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. In contrast, inhibition
      or blockade of the GJIC function (overexpression of mutant Cx43 tumor
      cells/Gap26) partially reversed the potentiating effect. The significant
      synergistic effect of Dio on HSV-Tk/GCV suicide gene therapy was further
      investigated in a B16 xenograft mouse model. The increased number and activation 
      ratio of CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the levels of Gzms-B, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha 
      in mice reconfirmed the potential modulatory effects of Dio on the immune system.
      Taken together, Dio targets Cx43 to enhance GJIC function, improve the antigens
      cross-presentation of DCs, and activate the antitumor immune effect of CD8(+) T
      lymphocytes, thereby providing insights into the potential immunomodulatory
      mechanism underlying combination therapy.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) remains one of the most ubiquitous human
      pathogens on earth. The classical presentation of HSV1 infection occurs as a
      recurrent lesions of the oral mucosa commonly refer to as the common cold sore.
      However, HSV1 also is responsible for a range of ocular diseases in
      immunocompetent persons that are of medical importance, causing vision loss that 
      may result in blindness. These include a recurrent corneal disease, herpes
      stromal keratitis, and a retinal disease, acute retinal necrosis, for which
      clinically relevant animal models exist. Diverse host immune mechanisms mediate
      control over herpesviruses, sustaining lifelong latency in neurons. Programmed
      cell death (PCD) pathways including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis serve 
      as an innate immune mechanism that eliminates virus-infected cells and regulates 
      infection-associated inflammation during virus invasion. These different types of
      cell death operate under distinct regulatory mechanisms but all server to curtail
      virus infection. Herpesviruses, including HSV1, have evolved numerous cell death 
      evasion strategies that restrict the hosts ability to control PCD to subvert
      clearance of infection and modulate inflammation. In this review, we discuss the 
      key studies that have contributed to our current knowledge of cell death pathways
      manipulated by HSV1 and relate the contributions of cell death to infection and
      potential ocular disease outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of the study is to report a case of ocular manifestations 
      in a patient with hydralazine-induced vasculitis. Observations: An 88-year-old
      female was admitted for lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Nine days after
      admission, she developed bilateral conjunctival chemosis and injection, which
      rapidly progressed into grouped blistering eruptions of the periorbital skin,
      face, and neck. After extensive testing and evaluation, her constellation of
      findings was diagnosed as hydralazine-induced vasculitis. Treatment with
      intravenous steroids and discontinuation of hydralazine resulted in improvement
      of the cutaneous and ocular manifestations. Herein we describe the clinical
      course of an adult patient with symptoms and signs consistent with
      hydralazine-induced vasculitis to highlight that ophthalmological manifestations 
      can be the first symptoms in patients with life-threatening dermatological
      conditions. Conclusions and Importance: To our knowledge, this report is the
      first case of hydralazine-induced vasculitis initially presenting with ocular
      manifestations.

      gluconate twice daily rinse on periodontal parameters and gingival crevicular
      fluid HSV1 and CMV levels in patients with chronic periodontitis: a multicentric

PG  - 157-163
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.08.002 [doi]
AB  - Background: Mechanical debridement of periodontal pockets remains the mainstay of
      therapy in all forms of periodontitis. There is 47% greater reduction in plaque
      amount when sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is used as an adjunct when compared with 
      water rinsing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 0.05% NaOCl
      and 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily rinse on periodontal parameters and
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) HSV1 and CMV levels in chronic periodontitis.
      Methods: Patients assigned to group A were prescribed 0.05% NaOCl mouthwash for
      twice daily rinse. Patients in group B were prescribed 0.12% chlorhexidine
      gluconate mouthwash to be used twice daily. Evaluation of periodontal parameters 
      was done at baseline and after six months following therapy. GCF HSV1 and CMV
      levels were evaluated using a polymerase chain reaction. Results: A statistically
      significant difference was noted in the improvement in periodontal parameters
      between both groups, when evaluated six months following therapy with greater
      reduction in group A vis-a-vis group B. Conclusion: NaOCl when prescribed as a
      twice daily mouthwash can be recommended as a part of the home care regime in
      patients with chronic periodontitis. It is more cost-effective, easily available 
      and can be beneficial to the troops in difficult terrains and extremes of
      climates, where oral healthcare facilities are not easily accessible.

      relationship? A systematic literature review.
PG  - 201-207
LID - 10.1007/s13365-022-01065-4 [doi]
AB  - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe, inflammatory,
      immune-mediated astrocytopathy of the central nervous system, characterized by
      recurrent inflammatory events primarily involving optic nerves and the spinal
      cord. Recently, a triggering role of infectious events in the development of
      NMOSD has been suggested. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the agent most
      involved, although the linkage with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies is so far
      unknown. A review of the literature on the association between NMOSD and VZV
      infection was carried out by searching PUBMED and EMBASE from 1975 to July 2020. 
      A total of 13 articles concerning Herpes zoster preceding NMOSD were identified. 
      All patients were female and the median age at NMOSD presentation was 28.5 (range
      5-63) years. Four NMOSD cases occurred after chicken pox while the remaining ten 
      after HZ. Full recovery occurred in 5/14 patients. From the review of the
      literature, we can infer that VZV seems to trigger LETM attacks and not the
      disease itself. The strict temporal relationship between VZV infection and NMOSD 
      seems to exceed the pure chance and represents an unusual clinical scenario
      posing several diagnostic and management challenges.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has had variable effects on the rates of STIs
      reported across the globe. This study sought to assess how the number of STI
      reports changed during the pandemic in Japan. METHODS: We used national
      infectious disease surveillance data from the National Institute of Infectious
      Diseases (Tokyo, Japan) for the period between January 2013 and December 2021. We
      compared reported rates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, condyloma acuminata and genital
      herpes, as well as total notifications for HIV/AIDS and syphilis during the
      pandemic versus previous years in Japan. We used a quasi-Poisson regression to
      determine whether any given week or month between January 2018 and December 2021 
      had a significant excess or deficit of STIs. Notification values above or below
      the 95% upper and lower prediction thresholds were considered as statistically
      significant. The start of the pandemic was defined as January 2020. RESULTS:
      Chlamydia generally remained within predicted range during the pandemic period.
      Reporting of gonorrhoea was significantly higher than expected throughout
      early-to-mid 2021 but otherwise generally remained within predicted range prior
      to 2021. Condyloma, herpes and HIV/AIDS reporting were transiently significantly 
      lower than expected throughout the pandemic period, but no significant periods of
      higher-than-expected reporting were detected. Syphilis showed widespread evidence
      of significantly lower-than-predicted reporting throughout 2020 but eventually
      reversed, showing significantly higher-than-predicted reporting in mid-to-late
      2021. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with variable changes in 
      the reporting of STIs in Japan. Higher-than-predicted reporting was more likely
      to be observed in the later phases of the pandemic. These changes may have been
      attributable to pandemic-related changes in sexual behaviour and decreased STI
      clinic attendance and testing, but further research on the long-term impact of
      the pandemic on STIs is necessary.

AB  - This case report describes an 84-year-old man who presented with 3 weeks of
      gradually worsening right arm weakness associated with a painful vesicular rash
      across his arm. This occurred 3 days after his first dose of the ChAdOx1
      nCoV-19/AZD1222 (University of Oxford, AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of
      India) vaccine. The diagnosis was complicated by the presence of right C5-C6
      foraminal stenosis compressing on the C6 nerve root sheath on non-contrast MRI,
      leading to an initial diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy. However, a positive
      varicella zoster virus-PCR test and findings of abnormal contrast enhancement of 
      his right C5-C7 nerve roots on gadolinium-enhanced MRI resulted in a revision of 
      his diagnosis to zoster radiculopathy. He was subsequently commenced on oral
      valacilovir and made significant recovery. This report aims to highlight the
      diagnostic dilemma between cervical radiculopathy secondary to spondylosis and
      zoster radiculopathy and how an erroneous diagnosis could result in
      inappropriate, aggressive surgical intervention and delayed treatment with
      antiviral therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Selectively replicating herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) vector is a
      promising treatment for cancer therapy. The insertion of multiple transgenes into
      the viral genome has been performed to improve its oncolytic activity. METHODS:
      Herein, we simultaneously constructed five "armed" oncolytic viruses (OVs),
      designated oHSV2-IL12, -IL15, GM-CSF, -PD1v, and IL7 x CCL19. These OVs delete
      the ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes with the insertion of transgenes into the deleted
      ICP34.5 locus. The anti-tumor efficacy in vivo was tested in the syngeneic 4T1
      and CT26 tumor-bearing mice model. RESULTS: The OVs showed comparable oncolytic
      capability in vitro. The combination therapy of oHSV2-IL12, -IL15, GM-CSF, -PD1v,
      and IL7 x CCL19 exhibited the highest tumor inhibition efficacy compared with the
      treatment of single OV or two OVs combination. CONCLUSIONS: The OVs armed with
      different transgenes combination therapy also named 5-valent oHSV2 (also called
      cocktail therapy) might be an effective therapeutic strategy for solid tumors.

      without QS21.

LID - 10.1038/s41541-022-00467-z [doi]
AB  - Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus
      (VZV) when VZV-specific cellular immunity is insufficient to control
      reactivation. Currently, Shingrix, which contains the VZV gE protein and GSK's
      AS01B adjuvant composed of liposomes formulated with cholesterol, monophosphoryl 
      lipid A (MPL) and QS21, is used for prevention of HZ. However, reactogenicity to 
      Shingrix is common leading to poor patient compliance in receiving one or both
      shots. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a newly formulated gE
      protein-based HZ vaccine containing Second-generation Lipid Adjuvant (SLA), a
      synthetic TLR4 ligand, formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion (SLA-SE) without
      QS21 (gE/SLA-SE). In VZV-primed mouse models, gE/SLA-SE-induced gE-specific
      humoral and cellular immune responses at comparable levels to those elicited by
      Shingrix in young mice, as both gE/SLA-SE and Shingrix induce polyfunctional
      CD4(+) T-cell responses. In aged mice, gE/SLA-SE elicited more robust gE-specific
      T-cell responses than Shingrix. Furthermore, gE/SLA-SE-induced T-cell responses
      were sustained until 5 months after immunization. Thus, QS21-free, gE/SLA-SE is a
      promising candidate for development of gE-based HZ vaccines with high
      immunogenicity-particularly when targeting an older population.

TI  - Activity of Propolis Nanoparticles against HSV-2: Promising Approach to
      Inhibiting Infection and Replication.
LID - 2560 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27082560 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) infection causes a significant life-long disease.
      Long-term side effects of antiviral drugs can lead to the emergence of drug
      resistance. Thus, propolis, a natural product derived from beehives, has been
      proposed to prevent or treat HSV-2 infections. Unfortunately, therapeutic
      applications of propolis are still limited due its poor solubility. To overcome
      this, a nanoparticle-based drug delivery system was employed. An ethanolic
      extract of propolis (EEP) was encapsulated in nanoparticles composed of
      poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and chitosan using a modified oil-in-water single
      emulsion by using the solvent evaporation method. The produced nanoparticles
      (EEP-NPs) had a spherical shape with a size of ~450 nm and presented satisfactory
      physicochemical properties, including positively charged surface (38.05 +/- 7.65 
      mV), high entrapment efficiency (79.89 +/- 13.92%), and sustained release
      profile. Moreover, EEP-NPs were less cytotoxic on Vero cells and exhibited
      anti-HSV-2 activity. EEP-NPs had a direct effect on the inactivation of viral
      particles, and also disrupted the virion entry and release from the host cells. A
      significant decrease in the expression levels of the HSV-2 replication-related
      genes (ICP4, ICP27, and gB) was also observed. Our study suggests that EEP-NPs
      provide a strong anti-HSV-2 activity and serve as a promising platform for the
      treatment of HSV-2 infections.

TI  - Development of Robust Varicella Zoster Virus Luciferase Reporter Viruses for In
      Vivo Monitoring of Virus Growth and Its Antiviral Inhibition in Culture, Skin,
      and Humanized Mice.
LID - 826 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040826 [doi]
AB  - There is a continued need to understand varicella-zoster virus (VZV) pathogenesis
      and to develop more effective antivirals, as it causes chickenpox and zoster. As 
      a human-restricted alphaherpesvirus, the use of human skin in culture and mice is
      critical in order to reveal the important VZV genes that are required for
      pathogenesis but that are not necessarily observed in the cell culture. We
      previously used VZV-expressing firefly luciferase (fLuc), under the control of
      the constitutively active SV40 promoter (VZV-BAC-Luc), to measure the VZV spread 
      in the same sample. However, the fLuc expression was independent of viral gene
      expression and viral DNA replication programs. Here, we developed robust reporter
      VZV viruses by using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology, expressing
      luciferase from VZV-specific promoters. We also identified two spurious mutations
      in VZV-BAC that were corrected for maximum pathogenesis. VZV with fLuc driven by 
      ORF57 showed superior growth in cells, human skin explants, and skin xenografts
      in mice. The ORF57-driven luciferase activity had a short half-life in the
      presence of foscarnet. This background was then used to investigate the roles for
      ORF36 (thymidine kinase (TK)) and ORF13 (thymidylate synthase (TS)) in skin. The 
      studies reveal that VZV-TS had increased sensitivity to brivudine and was highly 
      impaired for skin replication. This is the first report of a phenotype that is
      associated with the loss of TS.

TI  - Plasma Membrane-Derived Liposomes Exhibit Robust Antiviral Activity against
      HSV-1.
LID - 799 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040799 [doi]
AB  - Plasma membranes host a plethora of proteins and glycans on their outer surface
      that are exploited by viruses to enter the cells. In this study, we have utilized
      this property to limit a viral infection using plasma membrane-derived vesicles. 
      We show that plasma membrane-derived liposomes are prophylactically and
      therapeutically competent at preventing herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1)
      infection. Plasma membrane liposomes derived from human corneal epithelial (HCE) 
      cells, which are natural targets of HSV-1 infection, as well as Vero and Chinese 
      hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used in this study. Our study clearly demonstrates
      that HCE and Vero-derived cellular liposomes, which express the viral
      entry-specific cell surface protein receptors, exhibit robust antiviral activity 
      especially when compared to CHO-derived liposomes, which lack the relevant HSV-1 
      entry receptors. Further experimentation of the plasma membrane-derived liposomes
      with HSV type-2 (HSV-2) and pseudorabies virus yielded similar results,
      indicating strong potential for the employment of these liposomes to study viral 
      entry mechanisms in a cell free-environment.

TI  - Dermatitis during Spaceflight Associated with HSV-1 Reactivation.
LID - 789 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040789 [doi]
AB  - Human alpha herpesviruses herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and varicella zoster virus
      (VZV) establish latency in various cranial nerve ganglia and often reactivate in 
      response to stress-associated immune system dysregulation. Reactivation of
      Epstein Barr virus (EBV), VZV, HSV-1, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically
      asymptomatic during spaceflight, though live/infectious virus has been recovered 
      and the shedding rate increases with mission duration. The risk of clinical
      disease, therefore, may increase for astronauts assigned to extended missions
      (&gt;180 days). Here, we report, for the first time, a case of HSV-1 skin rash
      (dermatitis) occurring during long-duration spaceflight. The astronaut reported
      persistent dermatitis during flight, which was treated onboard with oral
      antihistamines and topical/oral steroids. No HSV-1 DNA was detected in 6-month
      pre-mission saliva samples, but on flight day 82, a saliva and rash swab both
      yielded 4.8 copies/ng DNA and 5.3 x 10(4) copies/ng DNA, respectively.
      Post-mission saliva samples continued to have a high infectious HSV-1 load (1.67 
      x 10(7) copies/ng DNA). HSV-1 from both rash and saliva samples had 99.9%
      genotype homology. Additional physiological monitoring, including stress
      biomarkers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and salivary amylase),
      immune markers (adaptive regulatory and inflammatory plasma cytokines), and
      biochemical profile markers, including vitamin/mineral status and bone
      metabolism, are also presented for this case. These data highlight an atypical
      presentation of HSV-1 during spaceflight and underscore the importance of viral
      screening during clinical evaluations of in-flight dermatitis to determine viral 
      etiology and guide treatment.

AB  - The bicyclic nucleoside analogue (BCNA) Cf1743 and its orally bioavailable

      to treat herpes zoster (shingles) and the therewith associated pain, including
      post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). The anti-VZV activity of Cf1743 depends on a
      specific phosphorylation by the VZV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK). The target of 
      antiviral action is assumed to be the viral DNA polymerase (or DNA synthesis in
      the virus-infected cells).

TI  - Structural Insight into KsBcl-2 Mediated Apoptosis Inhibition by Kaposi Sarcoma
      Associated Herpes Virus.
LID - 738 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040738 [doi]
AB  - Numerous large DNA viruses have evolved sophisticated countermeasures to hijack
      the premature programmed cell death of host cells post-infection, including the
      expression of proteins homologous in sequence, structure, or function to cellular
      Bcl-2 proteins. Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), a member of the
      gammaherpesvirinae, has been shown to encode for KsBcl-2, a potent inhibitor of
      Bcl-2 mediated apoptosis. KsBcl-2 acts by directly engaging host pro-apoptotic
      Bcl-2 proteins including Bak, Bax and Bok, the BH3-only proteins; Bim, Bid, Bik, 
      Hrk, Noxa and Puma. Here we determined the crystal structures of KsBcl-2 bound to
      the BH3 motif of pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Puma. The structures reveal that 
      KsBcl-2 engages pro-apoptotic BH3 motif peptides using the canonical ligand
      binding groove. Thus, the presence of the readily identifiable conserved BH1
      motif sequence "NWGR" of KsBcl-2, as well as highly conserved Arg residue (R86)
      forms an ionic interaction with the conserved Asp in the BH3 motif in a manner
      that mimics the canonical ionic interaction seen in host Bcl-2:BH3 motif
      complexes. These findings provide a structural basis for KSHV mediated inhibition
      of host cell apoptosis and reveal the flexibility of virus encoded Bcl-2 proteins
      to mimic key interactions from endogenous host signalling pathways.

TI  - Rotational Dynamics of The Transmembrane Domains Play an Important Role in
      Peptide Dynamics of Viral Fusion and Ion Channel Forming Proteins-A Molecular
      Dynamics Simulation Study.

AB  - Focusing on the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of viral fusion and channel-forming 
      proteins (VCPs), experimentally available and newly generated peptides in an
      ideal conformation of the S and E proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, gp41 and Vpu, both of human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), haemagglutinin and M2 of influenza A, as
      well as gB of herpes simplex virus (HSV), are embedded in a fully hydrated lipid 
      bilayer and used in multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations. It is aimed 
      to identify differences in the dynamics of the individual TMDs of the two types
      of viral membrane proteins. The assumption is made that the dynamics of the
      individual TMDs are decoupled from their extra-membrane domains, and that the
      mechanics of the TMDs are distinct from each other due to the different mechanism
      of function of the two types of proteins. The diffusivity coefficient (DC) of the
      translational and rotational diffusion is decreased in the oligomeric state of
      the TMDs compared to those values when calculated from simulations in their
      monomeric state. When comparing the calculations for two different lengths of the
      TMD, a longer full peptide and a shorter purely TMD stretch, (i) the difference
      of the calculated DCs begins to level out when the difference exceeds
      approximately 15 amino acids per peptide chain, and (ii) the channel protein
      rotational DC is the most affected diffusion parameter. The rotational dynamics
      of the individual amino acids within the middle section of the TMDs of the fusion
      peptides remain high upon oligomerization, but decrease for the channel peptides,
      with an increasing number of monomers forming the oligomeric state, suggesting an
      entropic penalty on oligomerization for the latter.

TI  - VZV Infection of Primary Human Adrenal Cortical Cells Produces a Proinflammatory 
      Environment without Cell Death.
LID - 674 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040674 [doi]
AB  - Virus infection of adrenal glands can disrupt secretion of mineralocorticoids,
      glucocorticoids, and sex hormones from the cortex and catecholamines from the
      medulla, leading to a constellation of symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness,
      weight loss, nausea, and muscle and joint pain. Specifically, varicella zoster
      virus (VZV) can produce bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and adrenal insufficiency
      during primary infection or following reactivation. However, the mechanisms by
      which VZV affects the adrenal glands are not well-characterized. Herein, we
      determined if primary human adrenal cortical cells (HAdCCs) infected with VZV
      support viral replication and produce a proinflammatory environment. Quantitative
      PCR showed VZV DNA increasing over time in HAdCCs, yet no cell death was seen at 
      3 days post-infection by TUNEL staining or Western Blot analysis with PARP and
      caspase 9 antibodies. Compared to conditioned supernatant from mock-infected
      cells, supernatant from VZV-infected cells contained significantly elevated IL-6,
      IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-4, and TNF-alpha. Overall, VZV can productively infect 
      adrenal cortical cells in the absence of cell death, suggesting that these cells 
      may be a potential reservoir for ongoing viral replication and proinflammatory
      cytokine production, leading to chronic adrenalitis and dysfunction.
